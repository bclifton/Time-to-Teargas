For much of his presidency, Bill Clinton's own aides have frequently complained that his attention to foreign policy was sporadic. The trait got him in trouble in Bosnia, and often resulted in some nasty surprises -- from the defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last fall to a tear-gas-filled week in Seattle that badly damaged his global economic agenda. But some of his biggest victories in 1999 were also scored abroad, from the air campaign over Serbia that largely halted ethnic bloodshed to the Northern Ireland accord that offers the first prospect of peace there.

Determined to conclude one of the longest and ugliest chapters in criminal justice history, a federal judge announced today that the inmates who were beaten and tortured during the 1971 Attica prison uprising have been offered a settlement of $8 million from New York State. The settlement, which provides an additional $4 million for lawyers' fees, is believed to be the biggest ever in a prisoners' rights case. But it may also be remembered as one of the longest and most vexing to hammer out, coming 25 years after a class-action civil suit was filed on behalf of 1,281 inmates over the storming of the western New York prison by state troopers. The uprising and siege left 43 people dead and more than 80 wounded.

Seattle officials said today that they were dropping all but about 40 of the unresolved misdemeanor cases stemming from the tumultuous street protests of the World Trade Organization meeting here a month ago. At least a few protesters said they opposed the city's move because they hoped to use their trials to showcase the city's mishandling of the demonstrations, which grew so raucous and tense that the National Guard was called in and the police used tear gas and rubber pellets to disperse the crowds.

Even before the rioting started on Sept. 9, 1971, the state prison in Attica, N.Y., was in ferment. So was the entire country. Two months earlier, angry Attica inmates had petitioned state correction officials to ease chronic overcrowding and censorship rules, and to improve conditions that limited them to one shower a week and one roll of toilet paper a month. A sign of the brewing unrest was a fast that the prisoners held on Aug. 22 in memory of George Jackson, a prominent black radical who had been killed by prison guards in California during a breakout attempt.

Energized by a new cause, hundreds of Cuban-Americans shut down much of Miami today with waves of civil disobedience, temporarily blocking access to the Port of Miami and choking traffic on dozens of busy streets to protest the Clinton administration's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. About 135 protesters were arrested by riot police officers, who led most of them away peacefully in plastic handcuffs as the crowd chanted, ''Libertad Elian, libertad Elian.''

THE immediate spark, not that it matters after so many years, was a series of misunderstandings. One evening, hours after a prison guard mistakenly thought they had been fighting, two inmates were taken from their cells for punishment. A rumor, no more true than the phantom fight, spread through the cellblock that both had been beaten. In a way, the whole thing was pretty silly. The consequences were anything but.

In the worst violence Kosovo has seen since the end of the war, seven Albanians were killed and at least nine wounded on Thursday night when about 500 people rampaged through the streets, bursting into apartments, firing guns and throwing grenades. The fierce fighting had subsided by daybreak, but the tension remained in this divided city as angry crowds of Serbs and Albanians gathered on either side of a bridge that spans the Ibar River, which runs through the heart of this industrial city 30 miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. The river separates the two communities; about 9,000 Serbs control the north bank, and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on the south side.

According to law-enforcement officials, Puffy Combs -- the rapper recently charged with throwing a 9-millimeter handgun out the window of his speeding Lincoln Navigator -- had installed a secret trap door to hide a weapon. The problem? The trap door's security system was so elaborate that in the heat of the moment no one in the car could figure out how to get it open. According to a report in The New York Post, one witness told the grand jury that Combs yelled: ''Trap! Trap! Open the trap!'' (Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of illegal gun possession.) Police say that secret gun vaults are increasingly common among certain high-risk drivers. And for those who have enough money and know the right auto-body mechanic, they are just one of the many options available. Trap Doors First used by drug gangs, these discreet compartments can keep illegal contraband (or legitimate cargo, should the need arise) safe and out of sight. As long as you can open them, that is: law-enforcement officials in New York have discovered traps -- inside dashboards, behind back seats, in door panels and floorboards -- that pop open only when the operator turns on the heat while the radio is set to a certain station, or when he inserts a hairpin into connections in the doorjamb while stepping on the brakes. More high-tech versions involve a series of microswitches that must be flipped in sequence. A few years ago, a drug gang in Washington Heights had a whole fleet of nondescript sedans whose traps could be opened only by inserting fuses into the second and fourth slots on the right column of the fuse box and then activating the rear-window defroster. ''Five years ago,'' one veteran New York City lawman said, ''these things were unusual. Now they're commonplace.'' Then again, he added, ''to some degree that's a function that we know to look for them now.'' Trap doors aren't actually illegal. Still, many alarm shops or auto detailers are leery of installing them. ''The police department frowns upon that kind of stuff,'' said the owner of a custom shop in the Bronx. ''If you start putting it in they give you a hard time. People ask me for safes, and I won't do it, because it's just too much to have in my head.'' Michael Trusio, a senior sales executive at Krystal Enterprises in Brea, Calif., agrees that it's business he'd rather not have. But, he added, ''we don't want to tell somebody no and then have someone come around and burn our plant down.'' Armor Car armor, which can include bulletproof glass in the windows, ballistic steel in the doors and body and Kevlar shields for the floorboards and gas tank, was once used for skittish billionaires and presidential motorcades. Today, it's just another accessory for the nation's wealthiest drivers. But all that security doesn't come cheap. Outfitting the family Mercedes in this bulletproof material can cost $100,000. And for some, that's just the beginning. ''I can think of 10 or 12 families who have armored cars for everyone,'' said Craig Fingold, the president of Beverly Hills Motoring, which has dubbed itself the Neiman Marcus of automotive accessories. Depending on the thickness, armor can add from 400 to 4,000 pounds to the weight of the car. Fingold said that a record mogul who had been threatened with death by a rapper had recently come in and had his Suburban outfitted with 4-inch metal -- enough to stop machine-gun fire. And Notorious B.I.G. stopped in to check out an armoring system but did not buy it. A few months later, he was shot to death in his Suburban. The Works Even drivers whose security concerns don't involve wielding or dodging heavy firepower have a number of self-defense toys to consider. Auto Taser ($200) delivers a powerful electric shock to anyone who lays an unwelcome hand on the steering wheel. Tiny video cameras ($800) that are installed with a clear view of the front seat can be useful for those who want evidence of police harassment; Fingold says they're especially popular with celebrities and sports figures. But for some wary drivers, the best defense is a good offense. Outfits like the Counter Spy Shops sell devices that spew oil, leaving a dangerous slick behind them ($1,300); they are reportedly popular in Russia, as are similar devices that spray a mist of oil on the windshield of the car behind ($1,300). Contraptions that scatter a large number of tacks in a car's wake -- first seen on countless Saturday-morning cartoons -- cost slightly more. (They start at $1,500.) Counter Spy claims it installed one for the Shah of Iran. Thankfully for the average American driver, however, most are available for export only. Finally, for those less afraid of fellow motorists than of airborne hazards, the smart choice is a tear-gas deterrent system that seals the car against unfiltered air ($5,000).

Popular anger erupted outside the United States Embassy today, a week after Israel retaliated against Lebanon for guerrilla attacks that killed several Israeli soldiers. Hundreds of Lebanese students joined with other protesters in throwing rocks and tomatoes at Lebanese army and police detachments, which responded with batons, tear gas canisters and high-pressure water hoses. The protests appeared to have been organized with the help of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Party of God, whose guerrillas have mounted an offensive in southern Lebanon that has killed seven Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks. In a fiery speech on Wednesday, the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, citing official American statements that supported the Israeli bombing, called on this nation of 3.5 million people to boycott the United States ambassador, David Satterfield, whom he described as ''the U.S.-Israeli ambassador in Lebanon.''

PETERSBURG -- Under heavy security because of a rumored assassination plot, President Vladimir V. Putin, left, attended the St. Petersburg funeral of his mentor and that city's first elected mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. Mr. Putin said Mr. Sobchak, who fled Russia from 1997 to 1999 after being accused of corruption, was a democratic visionary destroyed by persecution. Mr. Sobchak died after a heart attack last weekend. Michael Wines (NYT) SERBIA: MORE POLICE FOR KOSOVO -- Responding to the need for more civilian police officers in Kosovo and for other peacekeeping missions, the United States said it would create a permanent reserve of 2,000 officers to be available without delay. ''The recent slowness in deploying desperately needed civilian police to Kosovo provides only the latest evidence that present international capabilities are not adequate,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Elizabeth Becker (NYT)

With his one-day beard and tousled hair, Park Byung Ok retains a hint of the look of the student protesters who lobbed rocks and gasoline bombs at the police, who replied with tear gas and rubber bullets, in the often turbulent 1980's here. But these days, Mr. Park, 39, and his associates are launching nothing more lethal than e-mails -- many thousands -- to officials and political parties from civic groups that are sprouting around the country. The effects are rocking South Korea in ways never imagined by the radical opposition that many of the protesters belonged to a generation ago.

The incidents are notable for their brutality. A freshman football player on Long Island is badly beaten by his senior teammates; a high school wrestler in Trumbull, Conn., is hogtied, confined inside a gym locker and then sexually violated with a knife handle; a freshman hockey player at the University of Vermont is forced to perform a series of homoerotic acts. Hazing incidents, which are more and more in the news, are thought to reflect a rising level of violent incidents in our society and, as such, they have been roundly denounced. Some critics take it further and say all hazing must stop. The recent acts are criminal and should be prosecuted. But the very pervasiveness of hazing should also alert people that something else is going on. Unlike most violence, hazings are, to some degree, elective, and they result in an increase in status on the part of the victim. Moreover, hazing practices can be found in virtually every culture in the world.

My grandmother was shocked when I went to work for McDonald's. She thought I was cooking fries on Boulevard St.-Michel. It was 1984. McDonald's had 17 restaurants in France. Its headquarters was in an apartment. But I thought if I wanted to get ahead, I should join an American company. It would take me forever to run a French company: I'd have to know all the right people. I was 39 when I became McDonald's president two years ago -- very, very unusual for France. When I was invited to the World Cup, I sat in the box with French executives. I think they thought I was there to serve the drinks. Then one asked: ''Is your chauffeur waiting for you outside?'' I said: ''No, I have my subway ticket in my pocket.'' He couldn't believe it.

(AP) Bolivians Protest Water Rates The police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons to scatter crowds in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third-largest city, during protests against an increase in water rates. Chaos enveloped some streets of the city, which is 350 miles east of La Paz, as protesters threw rocks and firebombs at the police, who then stormed the rioters. Hundreds of police officers and soldiers have virtually taken control of the streets. (AP) World Briefing A6 NATIONAL A7-10, 14 Senate Adopts G.O.P. Plan For $1.8 Trillion Budget The Senate, voting 51 to 45 largely along party lines, approved a budget plan for next year that would raise spending on the military and education, cut or freeze spending in many domestic programs, reduce taxes by at least $150 billion over five years, add a $40 billion prescription drug benefit to Medicare and pay down publicly held debt with the surplus generated by Social Security. A1 Medicaid Rolls to Be Restored The Clinton administration ordered states to restore benefits to families improperly deprived of health insurance when they were left off the welfare rolls as an unintended consequence of the 1996 welfare law.

Kennedy, who has accused another general of sexual misconduct in 1996, senior defense officials said. The inquiry began after the Pentagon's inspector general received an electronic message from a retired officer who accused General Kennedy of personal misconduct during the mid-1980's.

To the Editor: Ken Tucker says the Sex Pistols existed to ''release an invigorating blast of poisonous gas into the clean, crisp air of the 70's pop-music industry'' [''This Time, the Sex Pistols' Point of View,'' April 2]. He should know better. That clean, crisp air he describes was nothing more than the combined flatulence of a herd of jaded, aging AOR or Album-Oriented Rock stars. I grew up in Los Angeles listening to not one, not two, but three horrible album rock stations that combined with the aforementioned rock stars to grind music into a droning, ''mellow,'' ''progressive'' haze. The fresh air was definitely delivered by the Pistols, the Ramones, the Clash and many others. It may have had remnants of tear gas in it, but it was definitely fresh. JOHN SUSOEFF Long Beach, Calif.

Official returns today showed President Alberto K. Fujimori approaching a first-round victory in Peru's presidential election, prompting cries of fraud and threats of civil disturbance. At the end of Sunday's voting, polls of voters and independent counts suggested that neither Mr. Fujimori, running for a third five-year term, nor his challenger, Alejandro Toledo, would garner a majority.

The custody battle over Elian Gonzalez has thrust Attorney General Janet Reno into what is most likely to be one of her last starring roles as she returned to her hometown, Miami, yesterday in a gesture that transformed a Justice Department legal fight into a one-woman crusade. The case has seemingly energized the 62-year-old Ms. Reno in the eighth and final year of her stewardship at the Justice Department. And today, at considerable risk to her credibility and reputation, she began a personal mission to reunite Elian with his father.

Defying tear gas and beatings by the police, hundreds of supporters of the jailed former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, marked the anniversary of his conviction today with a protest that led to 46 arrests. The police cordoned off several streets in downtown Kuala Lumpur, chased the demonstrators down alleys and beat them with canes in an attempt to disperse crowds that had gathered since late afternoon.

Thousands of protesters trying to shut down meetings of world financial leaders swarmed through the streets of the capital today, sealed off from their target by a virtual wall of police officers. A few brief clashes ensued, but for the most part, a day that some had feared would descend into chaos passed peacefully. The finance ministers and other delegates from around the world were loaded onto buses early this morning and escorted by the police so their meetings could take place as scheduled. This evening, they tacitly acknowledged the shouting on the streets by conceding in a communique issued by the International Monetary Fund that their role had become a matter ''of growing public debate.''

The world's top financial officials, trying to show sensitivity to poverty as protesters braved a chilling rain and an impenetrable police force outside, pledged to pay more attention to globalization's victims and to commit ''unlimited money'' to fight AIDS in poor countries. The finance ministers and central bank governors who oversee the World Bank said the bank should intensify its fight against AIDS because the disease is as much a problem of poverty as public health. More than 50 million people are infected with the virus that causes the disease, and it is spreading fastest in Africa, India, China and the Caribbean, all major World Bank clients. The bank has been active for more than a decade in fighting the disease.

The protesters marching downtown today failed to disrupt the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and its partner organization, the World Bank. But the protesters managed to halt the business of another influential Washington institution: the law firms and lobbying shops of K Street. K Street, both as an address and a symbol of the capital's influence industry, was the spine of a 20-block area that the city police cordoned off from traffic early today. Demonstrators marched up and down the avenue in their bid to stop the world financial leaders from pursuing their agenda. They failed, but, in a sense, they might have accomplished more than they realized.

Today's ruling only blocks the child from leaving the United States.

The action touched off a fury in the streets outside the home where Cuban exiles have kept a vigil since November.

Roaming along Flagler Street, a four-lane avenue that cuts east-west through Little Havana not far from the house where 6-year-old Elian had stayed, the demonstrators overturned Dumpsters and threw old appliances and garbage into the street. The police initially appeared to fall back along the perimeter of the troubled streets, allowing the protesters, many of them young Cuban-Americans carrying Cuban flags and placards denouncing the Clinton Administration, to slow traffic.

It was envisioned as a feel-good patriotic festival like the American Bicentennial. But the Brazilian government should have known that its plans to mark the 500th anniversary of the landing of the Portuguese were doomed when an irate Indian chief marched into Congress earlier this month, drew his bow and arrow and threatened to kill the Senate president. Sure enough, the yearlong commemoration got off to a bumpy start on Saturday, when military police officers used tear gas, nightsticks and rubber bullets to disperse 2,000 Indian-led demonstrators taking part in a ''march of the excluded'' in Porto Seguro, the focal point of the official celebrations.

Seattle certainly made a name for itself last December as host to the World Trade Organization meeting. The boosters' idea of using the summit to show off their city as a world-class friend to free trade didn't exactly pan out, amid all the demonstrations and the tear gas, but many residents think that the raucous protests against globalization amounted to a badge of honor for Seattle. Now the long-running tension here, between those who revel in the high-tech, high-wealth place Seattle has become and those who fret that the city is losing its quirky small-town charm, has a new focus: next month, a museum designed by Frank Gehry, known as the Experience Music Project, opens at the base of the Space Needle. Wildly curvy and colorful, built roughly in the shape of a guitar with the Seattle Center's monorail running through it, the museum is a celebration of modern music and includes a sound lab that, the museum says, lets you ''plug in, jam, dance, wail, scratch, learn, connect and, ultimately, experience the euphoria of making music.'' Some consider the building a brilliant addition to the architectural scene; some call it a curse on the civic landscape. Come and judge for yourself.

Deborah Sontag (NYT) ISRAEL: TYING UP BARAK -- Two opposition bills that could tie Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hands in negotiations with the Palestinians passed preliminary votes, although both require three more readings to become law. They would require absolute majority approval of the Parliament to change the municipal boundaries of Jerualem and to allow the right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. Deborah Sontag (NYT)

About 20,000 people gathered again tonight to protest the Serbian government's seizure of the main opposition television station here, Studio B, but as they were dispersing, policemen in riot gear charged them. There were clashes with the demonstrators, some of whom then threw stones and homemade firebombs at the police, who responded in turn with truncheons and a lavish use of tear gas. At least 19 people were hurt, beaten by the police, and ambulances picked them up at City Hall, where once again opposition political leaders conferred with one another but did not address the crowd.

HALAIQAH'S trip to Seattle last November was to have been the culmination of his career. As Jordan's most experienced trade negotiator, he had spent five years arduously preparing for his country's entry into the World Trade Organization. After a thorough and painful overhaul of its tariffs and investment rules, putting domestic industries like pharmaceuticals at risk, Jordan was finally poised to become the W.T.O.'s next full member. As the only country scheduled to join the group at its Seattle summit meeting, it hoped to attract worldwide publicity -- and American investment in the high-technology industries it sees as the key to its future.

Prime Minister Ehud Barak recalled his peace negotiators from Sweden today after a firebomb critically wounded a 2-year-old Israeli girl in a car passing through the sleepy Palestinian-ruled city of Jericho. The attack prompted Israel to block entrance to the Palestinian territories, declaring them unsafe for Israelis and tourists, and temporarily undercut a year of normalization efforts. The incident also undermined Palestinian attempts to restore order, although the Palestinians did clamp down on street fighting for the first time in 10 days.

ASIA JAPAN: PREMIER APOLOGIZES -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori apologized for remarks last week that seemed to endorse emperor worship. After several days of heavy criticism, Mr. Mori, left, expressed regret in a tense news conference that his remarks had caused misunderstanding, but declined to retract his statement altogether. In his original remarks, which critics said echoed Japan's prewar militarism, Mr. Mori said Japan was ''a divine nation with the emperor at its core.'' Howard French (NYT) SRI LANKA: MILITARY PLEA -- The government asked retired officers and policemen to re-enlist in the armed forces in hopes of bolstering 30,000 troops under assault from separatist ethnic Tamils in the northern Jaffna Peninsula. Those who rejoined would take the noncombat positions of younger soldiers, who would then be shifted to the front lines. The rebels threatened a bloodbath for soldiers who failed to surrender by today. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

In a runoff vote long on protest but short on suspense, President Alberto K. Fujimori swept to victory today against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because of what he called vote fraud and an array of campaign irregularities. Mr. Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would venerate his successes in defeating two terrorist groups and hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old president won a hollow victory leaving the country badly polarized and facing possible economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from recession.

For years, the Branch Davidian wrongful-death lawsuit seemed unlikely to amount to anything more than paper. The case file is about as thick as 25 metropolitan phone books, a tower of motions and countermotions once regarded as a monument to futility by those who doubted that the case would ever reach trial. But six years after the lawsuit was filed, the trial is scheduled to open on Monday in Federal District Court in Waco, Tex. Once criticized as a bundle of anti-government conspiracies, the lawsuit is now being taken very seriously. At its core lies the fundamental question of whether the government was negligent in the deaths of more than 80 Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993, when the sect's Mount Carmel compound near Waco burned to the ground.

The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the Israeli Army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques, riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers playing the roles of what an army official called ''the enemy'': Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists and homemakers. In the year-old mock village, the army experiments with techniques for controlling and reacting to violence in a way that is meant to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians.

Federal officials portrayed the jury's finding as a vindication for them in an episode that provided one of the darkest chapters in the history of federal law enforcement, threatened the career of Attorney General Janet Reno and continues to generate criticism. The lawsuit itself represents a six-year legal struggle that ultimately became a highly publicized test of the government's credibility.

John Danforth noted last Friday that his inquiry into the 1993 Waco disaster had been limited to ''whether government agents had engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.'' This is an important distinction. The report by Mr. Danforth, the special counsel, cleared Attorney General Janet Reno of any wrongdoing in the federal raid on the compound near Waco, Tex., occupied by a sect called the Branch Davidians. After a 51-day standoff, tanks driven by F.B.I. agents pumped tear gas into the compound, after which a fire broke out, claiming about 80 lives.

The police say they are ready. They've chopped down trees that could be set on fire, uprooted newspaper racks that could be used as battering rams and fenced off a good-size patch of downtown Los Angeles with tall silver swaths of chain-link in an effort to keep any protests at the Democratic National Convention from getting out of hand. The demonstrators say they are ready, too. They're building puppets to protest corporate greed, practicing passive resistance and media techniques, sharing organizing tips over the Internet and warily watching the police cars that circle their ''convergence center'' near MacArthur Park. They pledge, as one of their Web sites puts it, to ''celebrate and renew our resistance to corporate globalization, militarism, poverty, starvation, campaign finance corruption, sexism, racism, homo/trans-phobia, criminalization of youth, environmental destruction, prison industrial complex, genocide,'' and that's just for starters.

The long-awaited dance between protesters and the police turned into a violent confrontation tonight when some in the audience at a concert outside the Staples Center threw rocks and bottles at officers, who responded by firing rubber-coated bullets and pepper spray at the demonstrators and moved in on horseback to disperse them. The concert of protest itself, by the hard-rock, hip-hop band Rage Against the Machine, was peaceful enough, staged just outside the center in a fenced-off spot from which the authorities had tried to bar demonstrators until a federal judge intervened. But once the concert was over, some in the crowd threw the bottles and rocks over a high-security fence at police officers on the other side.

A federal judge today dismissed the wrongful death civil lawsuit brought by Branch Davidians, clearing the government of any wrongdoing in the deaths of about 80 members of the religious sect during the disastrous 1993 standoff at the group's compound near Waco, Tex. The judge, Walter Smith Jr. of Federal District Court in Waco, issued an order that found that federal agents had acted legally and could not be held liable for the deaths. His ruling ended a legal battle that lasted nearly seven years and came after an advisory jury in the case and a special counsel, former Senator John C. Danforth, both issued similar findings in July.

THE black plumes of smoke rising from Yugoslavia's federal Parliament building as a flag-waving throng storms the building will forever define the Serbian revolution that toppled Slobodan Milosevic. In its way, the image has the force of the photograph of a soldier planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945. Both images are overwhelming in their glorious finality. But Yevgeny Khaldei's Reichstag photograph was a perfect representation of victory in a bloody war, whereas the iconic images of the end of Mr. Milosevic's 13-year rule seem to offer a partial truth. Without the critical injection of force at a pivotal moment -- the hard men from central Serbia storming past the hesitant police and their tear gas -- the opposition's protests might have proved as ineffectual as they so often had in the past. But Mr. Milosevic was downed less by violent upheaval than by the broad, massive, nonviolent protest that has characterized the fall of so many authoritarian regimes in recent years.

Today, the government arrested three opposition members of Parliament on charges of inciting violence and sprayed tear gas on scores of their supporters, who sang and chanted outside the courthouse before scattering through clouds of choking smoke.

As anxiety rose that the conflict might escalate and spread, an international intervention effort intensified with the arrival of the United Nations secretary general and Russia's foreign minister.

Hezbollah's capture of three Israeli soldiers along the Lebanese border on Saturday was a well-planned operation intended to coincide with the outburst of Palestinian protests over control of a Jerusalem site sacred to both Muslims and Jews, according to leaders of the guerrilla group and military experts. Hezbollah's immediate goal, they say, was to swap the three sergeants for 19 Islamic militants in Israeli jails, although in the bargaining the total may go as high as 49. Israel has said that it is holding the 19 Lebanese prisoners without trial as bargaining chips for information on three of its soldiers missing in Lebanon since 1982 and an airman, Ron Arad, whose fighter-bomber crashed in Lebanon in 1987.

Several hundred Jews, apparently tired of feeling trapped for 12 days in this predominantly Arab city, rampaged on Sunday night, attacking Arab homes and touching off a melee in which the Israeli police killed two Arabs, more than a dozen Arab witnesses said. The troubles began shortly after evening religious services for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, when Jews swept through Arab neighborhoods shouting, ''Death to Arabs!'' hurling stones through windows and attacking Arabs.

The opposition legislators now speak the language of ayes and nays, motions and resolutions and their names appear in neat black type on white government doors. But the jubilation over their sweep in June elections of more than a third of parliamentary seats has quickly dissolved into discontent. In recent weeks, the opposition has watched helplessly as the government has pardoned the perpetrators of political violence, drafted governing party militants into a militia and allocated millions of dollars more to the costly war in Congo while shabby hospitals here run short of syringes.

Twelve seats in the 630-seat lower house and six in the 315-seat Senate are to be allocated to representatives of Italians abroad, of whom there are about 4 million, with more than 300,000 in the United States and Canada. First, however, a law must be passed setting up candidates' procedural rules. Voting by absentee ballot is not allowed. Alessandra Stanley (NYT) FRANCE: CABINET RESIGNATION -- Martine Aubry, the cabinet minister who shepherded the introduction of the government's 35-hour workweek policy, has quit her cabinet post to run for mayor of Lille. The widely expected move is seen as a steppingstone to run for higher office in 2002. If Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is expected to run for president in 2002, were to win, Mrs. Aubry could well replace him as prime minister. Mr. Jospin named his justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to take over Mrs. Aubry's portfolio. Suzanne Daley (NYT)

Prime Minister Ehud Barak, elected on a platform of peacemaking, announced tonight that he was prepared to take an indefinite ''timeout'' from the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. That would pave the way for him to forge a national emergency government with the right-wing opposition next week. Mr. Barak's announcement came at the end of one of the worst days of violence since the current conflict began raging three weeks ago, and on the eve of a weekend summit meeting of Arab leaders. After Palestinians confronted Israeli soldiers at checkpoints throughout the West Bank, 10 Palestinians were killed in clashes that defied the truce agreement forged early this week in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt.

Trying to heal a rift with Israel's Arab citizens, Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced an inquiry today into the deaths of 13 Israeli Arabs in the current unrest and unveiled a four-year development plan for Arab communities. The moves were met with skepticism by Israeli Arab leaders, who said that the inquiry, by a committee of experts and retired judges instead of an official state commission, would lack binding authority. The development plan, they said, failed to address the roots of inequality of Israel's one million Arab citizens.

Here's a day in the life of Israel and Palestine: I arrive in Jerusalem from Hong Kong at 5 a.m. The taxi drops me at the door of the King David Hotel. I walk in. The lobby is completely dark and empty. Not a soul, not a bellhop, is stirring, not even a mouse. ''Hello,'' I shout into the dark, wondering if my travel agent has made a mistake and the hotel has been closed. ''Is anybody home? Hello!'' Finally a desk clerk emerges from a dark corner, where he has been sleeping on a couch. The hotel has laid off most of its employees, because tourism is dead. ''Am I the only one staying here?'' I ask. The clerk just chuckles. The following morning I drive to Ramallah with a Palestinian journalist friend. When we arrive at the back entrance to the city, a ''clash'' is underway. There is a long, wide street. The Israeli soldiers are on our end hiding behind three armored cars, popping out to fire tear gas, rubber bullets and real bullets at the Palestinian youths, who are pelting the soldiers with rocks and marbles from behind a pile of burned-out cars. Behind the Palestinians, five Palestinian ambulances are parked. When a Palestinian youth goes down, an ambulance races out, siren screaming, and the wounded boy is bundled off to the hospital, like a Roman gladiator scraped up off the ring. Behind them, a crowd of 300 Palestinians, of various ages, are simply watching the scene. A vendor is selling kebabs.

In Manger Square, spiffed up just last Christmas for what was supposed to be a banner year for the now-dead Palestinian tourism industry, thousands of Muslims bowed in prayer today to mourn a paramilitary leader assassinated by the Israelis. The dead man, Hussein Obaiyat, 34, a baker by trade, a gun collector by avocation, was not well known here beyond his clan and the paramilitary unit that he ran for Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization. But when Israel used helicopter gunships to kill him on Thursday, and killing two middle-aged women as well, it instantly secured him a place in the pantheon of Palestinian heroes.

Two days after ousting a head of Congress loyal to President Alberto K. Fujimori, opposition lawmakers named their candidate today to lead the legislature, threatening to undermine further Mr. Fujimori's fading hold on power. Also today, the police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of leftist-led construction workers who were demonstrating outside the Government Palace. The protesters carried an effigy with two heads, Mr. Fujimori's and that of the former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, in a cage. Tear gas canisters flew after some protesters, carrying wood poles and shouting, ''There is no president!'' charged at the police.

It is Wednesday, and just another day at the office for Brig. Gen. Benjamin Gantz, commander of Israel's forces throughout the West Bank.

In the evening, a few hundred yards from his fortress headquarters, General Gantz's troops battled rioters, firing tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and sporadic bursts of live ammunition.

An Israeli diplomat was shot and slightly wounded outside his home in Jordan today, raising fresh concerns that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is affecting neighboring countries that have already made peace with Israel.

The Israelis also said the Palestinian police were making a visible effort to prevent shooting for the first time since the violence began in late September.

Following are excerpts from the Florida Supreme Court's decision yesterday that said the State Legislature should develop a standard for counting ballots.

Fred Lewis, Barbara J. Pariente and Peggy A. Quince concurred, with Justices Shaw and Pariente filing separate opinions. Justice Major B. Harding and Chief Justice Charles T. Wells concurred in result only, with the chief justice filing a separate one-sentence opinion. FROM THE OPINION This case is before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court. In our previous opinion, we ordered the Circuit Court of Leon County to tabulate by hand 9,000 contested Dade County ballots. This court further held that relief would require manual recounts in all Florida counties where undervotes existed which had not previously been subject to manual tabulation.

A little before noon on the last day of his life, 15-year-old Ahmed Abutayeh invented a toothache. This was the first time he had ever complained of a health problem in school, so his science teacher wrote him a permission slip to visit a nearby clinic. Ahmed shouldered his plaid-patterned book bag and walked out of the Rimal Boys' School and onto the chaotic streets of Beach Camp, where 75,000 Palestinian refugees are corralled into a half-square-mile block, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. It was Nov. 1 of this year. The previous day, Ahmed had sold his pet nightingale for a few shekels, and now, carrying this money, he caught a taxi and asked to be driven to a place called Karni crossing. He was wearing the nicest shirt he owned, a light blue button-down, and a few dabs of his father's cologne. On the outside of his book bag, in blue ink, he had inscribed a four-word epitaph: ''The Martyr Ahmed Abutayeh.'' Karni crossing, as its name implies, is an intersection. It's where the Karni Road crosses the so-called Green Line, the razor-wire border dividing the occupied territory of Gaza from Israel proper. The Gaza Strip is a place small enough to be easily fenced. It pokes from the northern end of the Egypt-Israel border and follows the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea; its silhouette is roughly that of a pistol, aimed just west of Jerusalem. Karni crossing is at a point about midway along the pistol's barrel.

In 1972, I was a junior TV journalist assigned to watch events in Northern Ireland, which that weekend happened to include a protest march in Derry.

Like everyone else, I was taken completely by surprise when paratroops burst through barriers, ran toward the crowd and almost instantly began firing. This is the last damn straw! I remember thinking as I crushed my nose into the roadway's asphalt with high-velocity bullets cracking and whining over me. I was 23 and scared witless, but my thoughts came embroidered with bravado. I had covered enough of ''the troubles'' to have been threatened at gunpoint by Protestant paramilitaries and another time been forced to run from I.R.A. sniper fire. Now, I blustered to myself, it is my own national army who's firing at me.

Protesters seeking new elections fought running battles with the police today as violence spread across Tanzania and left as many as 17 people dead. Opposition officials and doctors said 16 protesters had been killed on Zanzibar's main islands of Unguja and Pemba as demonstrations across the archipelago calling for a rerun of disputed elections turned violent. One member of the security forces was decapitated, a police official said.

The Chinese authorities, facing constant protests by aggrieved workers and farmers and a prospect of unending defiance by die-hard Falun Gong believers, have ordered cities across the country to augment their anti-riot police. Reflecting the leadership's obsession with ''social stability,'' which has reached a new pitch as China seeks to be awarded the 2008 Olympic Games, the Ministry of Public Security has ordered ''intensive efforts'' to build up anti-riot squads and said they are ''expected to play key roles in handling group violence and terrorism cases.''

As protests against President Abdurrahman Wahid erupted into violence outside Parliament today, an investigative committee inside submitted a report to lawmakers that suggested that Mr. Wahid acted improperly in two multimillion-dollar corruption scandals. In a closed-door session, the 50-member committee presented the findings of its six-month inquiry into accusations that Mr. Wahid may have been involved in the embezzlement of $3.7 million from a government agency and that he improperly accepted $2 million from the sultan of Brunei.

Throughout the spring of 1989, Tiananmen Square, the political heart of Beijing, was engulfed in protests. By June, many of the people filling the square and surrounding streets were spectators with only the vaguest political motives. It was into these crowds that the People's Liberation Army opened fire in the early hours of June 4, killing hundreds or even thousands of civilians. No one outside the inner councils of the Chinese government knows for certain how many people died or why. The recently published ''Tiananmen Papers,'' transcripts of government documents reportedly smuggled out of the country by a disaffected Chinese official, claim to tell what happened behind the high red walls of China's leadership compound in the weeks before the massacre. Their appearance suggests that, even within the government, the wounds of Tiananmen still fester, and that some insiders are ready to reassess the wisdom of the decisions that led to the shooting that night.

Juan Tovar Santos, an assembly-line worker in this border city, will not forget the time he traveled to Alcoa's annual shareholders meeting in Pittsburgh and confronted the chief executive about working conditions in Alcoa factories here. After Paul H. O'Neill, the Alcoa chief executive who became President Bush's treasury secretary last month, trumpeted the company's growing profits, Mr. Tovar stepped to a microphone. At the time Mr. Tovar, who was earning about $6 a day, described Alcoa managers so stingy that they stationed a janitor at bathroom doors to limit workers to just three pieces of toilet paper. He also recounted an incident in which more than 100 workers had been overcome by fumes from a gas leak and taken to hospitals.

After years of shuttling Gazan laborers into Israel without incident, a Palestinian bus driver who passed a strict Israeli security clearance just two weeks ago veered wildly off course today with deadly consequences. Plowing into a crowd of soldiers and commuters at a bus stop here, the Palestinian driver killed eight Israelis during the morning rush hour. His hit-and-run assault, which was presumed to be an unorthodox terror attack by an unlikely terrorist, caused the highest single-day Israeli death toll since the Palestinian uprising erupted early last fall.

But before Mr. Bush and other leaders could get down to work, tonight's opening ceremony of the Summit of the Americas was delayed for an hour, to about 7:30, as thousands of mostly young protesters clogged the narrow streets of this walled city seeking to block talks over a Free Trade Area of the Americas.

The Summit of the Americas got under way in this fortified city today with 34 leaders passing through color guards and red-coated Mounties inside the delegates' hall, while outside hooded protesters tangled with riot policemen under billowing clouds of tear gas. A crowd that the police estimated at 2,000 tore down about 150 feet of a chain-link fence atop concrete barricades that had been erected near the convention center where President Bush and the other leaders of the Western Hemisphere gathered this afternoon.

For a second day, the old streets of this historic city were mobbed today with people protesting the proceedings of the third Summit of the Americas. The biggest crowd -- a good mile long and a boulevard wide -- marched for hours without incident or trouble yet with evident concern for the panoply of issues that angered, frightened or frustrated them enough to come here. But on the other side of Quebec, police officers used a water cannon, rubber bullets and a continual shower of tear gas to repeatedly push back the front ranks of more than 6,000 protesters at a few key points not far from the meeting site. One of the most prolonged confrontations took place at a weak point in the concrete and chain-link fence around the official summit meeting area that had been breached briefly during protests on Friday afternoon.

President Bush told the leaders of the Western Hemisphere today that after almost a decade of delays in creating a single market from the Arctic to the tip of South America, the time had come to ''build an age of prosperity in a hemisphere of liberty.'' At the same time, Mr. Bush cautiously reached out to the thousands here who were protesting his drive to expand the Nafta accord throughout Central and South America. He sent members of his administration to meet a variety of labor, environmental and human rights groups that Republicans have previously dismissed as protectionists and the enemy of trade accords.

The official toll issued by Ghana to day at least 123 deaths and 93 injuries -- turned a stampede at a soccer match on Wednesday into the worst sporting disaster in Africa's history and pushed to nearly 180 the number of spectators killed across the continent in the last month. The deaths in a stadium in Accra, the capital of the West African nation, followed similar incidents in Ivory Coast, in Congo and in South Africa. In all cases, many have accused the police of having failed to control the unruly crowds and, in at least two incidents, of making the stampedes worse by firing excessive amounts of tear gas.

Africa's fourth soccer tragedy in a month became its deadliest, as 123 fans were killed in a soccer stampede in Accra, Ghana, during a match between two of the country's top teams. It raised to about 180 the total number of spectators killed across the continent, since 43 fans died trying to get into a packed stadium in South Africa last month. The incident also highlighted the poor security in most of Africa's stadiums. Few have security personnel managing crowds and rely instead on police officers who tend to overreact in riots by indiscriminately firing tear gas. Norimitsu Onishi

With the arrival of the reality show ''Big Brother'' here this month, the French are proving to be no more highbrow than Spaniards, Italians, Britons, Americans and others before them. Overnight the French have become hooked, tuning in by the millions every evening to watch five men and five woman engaged in an elimination contest in an enclosed space under the eyes of 26 cameras. But wait. Perhaps the French are different after all. ''Loft Story'' (the show's title is in English) may be as hypnotically banal as earlier versions of ''Big Brother'' elsewhere, but at least here there is the additional entertainment of an immense furor stirred by the show off screen. The question is even being posed: Should the land of Molière, Montaigne and Voltaire be allowed to watch ''trash TV,'' as reality shows have been tagged here?

The police fired water cannon and tear gas at rioters today as hundreds of thousands of protesters marched on Algeria's presidential palace demanding greater democracy. Two people died and more than 400 were injured in the turmoil. Ethnic Berbers organized the mass protest against discrimination and they were joined by opposition parties demanding greater freedom, presenting Algeria's military-backed government with a growing challenge even as it battles the separate threat of an Islamic insurgency.

A formal inquiry this month into the police killing of 13 people in violent protests by Israeli Arabs in October has raised questions about several of the shootings, particularly whether the police needed to fire live ammunition. It has also served as a platform to air what Israeli Arabs say is discrimination that has gone on for decades. The three-member commission, headed by a Supreme Court judge, Theodor Or, drew attention last week during its inquiry into the death of Asel Asleh, a 17-year-old Israeli Arab peace advocate killed by police gunfire during a stone-throwing protest, part of a wave of Israeli Arab protests last fall in support of the Palestinian uprising.

Two months of slowly mounting protests by the Berber minority exploded last week into the biggest popular outpouring since independence in 1962 when thousands of Algerians seized the chance to vent their own grievances against the government. While the hundreds of thousands of Berbers who descended on the capital have since returned to their home provinces, the challenge they have opened to a government widely seen as repressive and ineffective is far from dissipated.

Two adults and 11 children at Public School 191 on the Upper West Side were sickened yesterday when a student discharged a canister of Mace, a form of tear gas, the police said. The student, an 11-year-old girl in special education, reached into her purse at 10:30 a.m., when she uncapped the irritant, apparently by accident, the police said. It was unclear why the girl carried the canister. The students, a teacher and a parent were taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where they were treated for inflamed eyes and throat and released. Jacob H.

PLANTS, like buildings, hold memories. They are flourishing beneath the cellblock here on Alcatraz, this famously foreboding rock, as they have since military days, when this island -- buffeted by winds and currents -- was a fortress defending San Francisco Bay. The sweet scent of honeysuckle mingles with the salty air. The old warden's house, now a ruin overtaken by a fugitive garden, looks like an Aubusson carpet of roses and nasturtiums. Flowers are everywhere on Alcatraz at this time of year -- snaking up barbed wire fences, threatening to subsume the hillside where Al Capone traveled from his cell to laundry detail. Some ancient roses are holdovers from the 19th-century military era, when officers' wives sipped iced tea in cottage gardens. Others were planted and tended by inmates like Elliott Michener, who arrived in 1941, a convicted counterfeiter who couldn't resist a geranium.

A 23-year-old Italian protester was shot and killed today by a police officer during a riot less than two miles from a gathering of leaders of the world's largest industrialized nations, who were protected by a 13-foot fence that anti-globalization demonstrators had vowed to breach. The killing in Genoa, a medieval seaport converted into a 21st-century citadel, is the first death during an anti-globalization demonstration since the movement tempestuously surfaced at a World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999. Today's grim milestone deepened an already widespread feeling that these kinds of international conferences -- and the vast and often violent protests they inspire -- cannot go on unchanged any longer.

The court found that the man brought on the attack by taking part in the protest.

Here is what a quiet day looks like during the nominal ceasefire in Israel: today, just one car, packed with explosives, nails, and ammunition, blew up along a busy street here, and it did not hurt anybody. The Bush administration has urgently sought a truce between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's coalition government and Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority. But so far the antagonists' mincing steps toward peace have yielded what is, even by this region's standards, a most unstable situation: a cease-fire that won't, a unity government that isn't, and a Palestinian Authority that doesn't have much, or at least won't exercise it to the Israelis' satisfaction.

Protests against the airstrikes in Afghanistan erupted into extraordinary confrontations today in the Gaza Strip, when Palestinian security forces opened fire on Palestinian student demonstrators and killed at least two people, including a 13-year-old boy. In sending his own police against a crowd of some 2,000 Palestinians, Yasir Arafat appeared to make a clear choice in the international battle against terror: he is with the United States, and against Osama bin Laden. But, on a day when Mr. Arafat, like many other Arab leaders, enveloped himself in silence, it was not clear why he had decided to act as he did.

Today, Yasir Arafat took a gamble, confronting a radical Palestinian crowd in a bid to shore up his own position and assert his international credibility as the possible leader of a Palestinian state. For the first time in years, Mr. Arafat's security forces used deadly force against Palestinians to suppress a demonstration in support of Osama bin Laden. In a cloud of tear gas and a hail of bullets, two Palestinians -- one of them only 13 -- were slain. Another was close to death.

A thousand years ago, in the days of the camel caravans, storytellers gathered here in the tea shops and brought the outside world and all its thoughts and ideas to the bazaar. As the vendors hawked silk, spice and rich tapestries and traders herded beasts through streets thick with smoke from cooking fires, travelers from distant lands and differing religions told stories about moguls, magic, wit and wisdom. In time, the bazaar came to be known as Qissa Khwani -- the Bazaar of the Storytellers. Now, the streets are still choked with donkey carts, and meat still sizzles on open pits, but the vendors are poor men selling simple things. Blaring car horns drown out all other sound, just as the teachers and students in the Islamic seminaries that surround this bazaar have drowned out all conflicting ideas, all unacceptable thoughts.

While bombs fall in Afghanistan, a quieter war is being waged in the dusty border city of Quetta and, farther north, in the mud-brick city of Peshawar. It is a clandestine affair, intended to win converts for an attempt to overthrow the Taliban. Mujahedeen commanders, tribal chiefs and other prominent Afghans opposed to the ruling Taliban gather in carpet shops, in coffee houses and behind closed doors in both cities to discuss shifting alliances and strategies for exploiting a schism among Taliban leaders. Some travel from Afghanistan, crossing the mountains for talks that could shape the future of their country and the outcome of the American war.

Trade ministers from 142 nations will meet in Doha, Qatar, today for a conference of the World Trade Organization. Their agenda is much the same as the ill-fated ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, when attempts to bridge the gap between poor and wealthy countries' priorities blew up in a cloud of tear gas. The whole world has an interest in seeing this gathering turn out better. With the world's terrorized economy stuck at a standstill, the time is ripe for a cooperative, international push for growth through trade. The ministers' goal in Qatar is to launch a new set of comprehensive trade negotiations. During the original Uruguay Round, which led to the creation of the W.T.O., rich countries pledged to open their markets to textiles, crops and other basic exports from the developing world. There has been some progress in that area, but arcane customs rules, unnecessary red tape, stingy quotas and anti-dumping programs still keep poor nations' exports out of wealthy markets. Now protectionist politicians are trying to erect more barriers by exploiting concerns about border security and food safety.

As Israeli military pressure on Yasir Arafat eased slightly today, the pressure on him from Palestinian extremists grew. Defying efforts by Mr. Arafat to arrest him and to restrain his militant group, Dr. Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, a top political leader of Hamas, said today that Hamas's military wing intended to continue sending suicidal attackers against Israel. For a second night, forces of Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority clashed with Hamas supporters near Dr. Rantisi's house.

President Fernando de la Rúa resigned today, halfway through his four-year term, swamped by violent protests and looting that erupted when his government failed to reverse a deepening economic crisis. The resignation letter, which was delivered to Congress late in the day, followed violent food riots and protests here and in several cities. At least five demonstrators were killed today, bringing the death toll to 21 since the protests began early Wednesday.

The government denied assertions that Lori Berenson, the American serving a 20-year sentence for aiding a leftist rebel group, was mistreated while being transferred to another prison last week. But her lawyer said he would broaden a complaint he had filed to include an accusation of sexual abuse. Her father, Mark Berenson, has also said she was molested. The justice ministry said that it ''denies the 'grave injury' her lawyers have denounced'' and that Ms. Berenson, 32, is ''in good health.'' Ms. Berenson's lawyer, José Luís Sandoval, said she was beaten and sprayed with tear gas by the police when she and another prisoner were taken from their cells last Friday. He also said Ms. Berenson had been fondled by a police officer. The justice ministry said that the transfer had been carried out according to regulations and that tear gas had been used when prisoners resisted the police.

THE economy may have slowed during 2001, but news in the business world didn't skip a beat. Among its highs and lows were many moments that were memorable for their importance, their humor or their sheer brazenness. Were you paying attention? Try this test. PART 1 Who spoke these words and about what? 1) ''It is not good news for America.'' 2) ''She has the full support of the board and will continue to lead the company through these challenging times.'' 3) ''The more I see about this deal, the less I like it.'' 4) ''I was smiling going in, because how often in your life do you and your company have an opportunity to make a difference?'' 5) ''I have no desire to be next at bat.'' 6) ''We are on the side of angels.'' 7) ''This is an industrial policy designed for shareholders of the winning companies.'' 8) ''It would be a good time for all parties to sit down together and see what kind of resolution can be worked out.'' 9) ''Today, America goes back to business.'' 10) ''What keeps me up at night is doing my own e-mail. I wouldn't say that anything keeps me up at night worrying.'' PART 2 What were these people talking about when they spoke these words? 1) In April, a senior Bush administration official said, ''It would be like having a cheeseburger without cheese.'' 2) In March, Dick Conway, an economist in Seattle, said, ''Well, it has made us forget the earthquake all of a sudden.'' 3) In September, Alexander Danielides, a junior at the Bronx High School of Science, said, ''The Vietnam generation is a little more cautious than we would be.'' 4) In April, Ira Kay, a consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said, ''It's the gift that keeps on giving.'' 5) In June, Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, said: ''It is one thing for one shark to eat another. It is quite another for the shark to eat the minnows.'' 6) In April, Elliot Schrage, senior vice president for global affairs at Gap Inc., said: ''We are not the all-powerful Oz that rules over what happens in every factory. Do we have leverage? Yes. Is it as great as our critics believe? Not by a long shot.'' 7) In March, Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, said, ''I've decided to take this issue off the table.'' 8) In December, Thomas R. Eisenmann, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, said, ''This was another big move in this continuing clash of titans.'' 9) In January, Kathleen Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for Lucent Technologies, said, ''Henry decided it was not the best use of our assets.'' 10) In September, Fay Weldon said: ''I thought: 'Oh no, dear me, I am a literary author. You can't do this kind of thing; my name will be mud forever.' But then after a while I thought: 'I don't care. Let it be mud.' '' ''Answers to the Quiz'' PART 1 1) President Bush, commenting on the October unemployment rate. 2) Stanley Silverstein, general counsel of Warnaco, speaking about its chief executive, Linda J. Wachner, as Warnaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June. Mrs. Wachner was fired in November. 3) Walter B. Hewlett, declaring his opposition to Hewlett-Packard's plan to merge with Compaq Computer. 4) Helge H. Wehmeier, chief executive of Bayer's American operations, referring to the company's agreement to sell its anthrax medicine, Cipro, to the government at a discounted price. 5) Robert W. Pittman, chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, after his peer and rival, Richard D. Parsons, was named to succeed Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive, next May. 6) Jeffrey K. Skilling, former chief executive of Enron, in March, dismissing critics who saw Enron as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. 7) Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor, criticizing the legislation passed to bail out the nation's airlines after the terrorist attacks. 8) Bill Gates, in June, commenting after a federal appeals court threw out a lower court's order that Microsoft be broken up. 9) Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, reopening the exchange after it was closed for four days as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks. 10) Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and the Intel Corporation, upon his retirement last spring, discussing the widespread use of personal computers. PART 2 1) He was referring in general to the demonstrations that accompany world trade talks (in this case, the Summit of the Americas that took place in Quebec) and specifically to the tear gas that authorities use to break up the protests. 2) He was commenting on the announcement that Boeing was moving its corporate headquarters out of Seattle after decades as the mainstay of the region's economy. 3) This teenage investor was talking, a few days after Sept. 11, about the willingness of his generation to stay in the stock market when conventional wisdom suggested otherwise. 4) He was describing reload stock options, a form of compensation that gives executives who exercise them both a share of stock and a new option. 5) He was questioning Wall Street's erosion of ethical conduct at a Congressional hearing on conflicts among brokerage firm research analysts. 6) He was commenting on the difficulties of trying to improve conditions in foreign factories. 7) He was announcing his decision to sell about $100 million worth of Alcoa stock and options that he had planned to keep. 8) He was referring to the battle over broadband between AOL Time Warner and Microsoft after Comcast outbid rivals for AT&T's cable television business. 9) She was discussing the decision by Henry B. Schacht, the interim chief executive of Lucent, to sell the Hamilton Farm Golf Club, an expensive white elephant that the company developed before its fortunes plunged, causing huge layoffs, write-offs and restructuring. 10) She was commenting on her new novel, ''The Bulgari Connection,'' for which Bulgari, the Italian jewelry company, paid her an undisclosed amount in return for a prominent place in the book.

About 500 asylum-seekers who live at a refugee camp near the French end of the Channel Tunnel made a break for England. In two waves, the men -- mostly Afghans, Iranians and Kurds -- broke the electric fence guarding the entrance. Some poured into the tunnel to be chased down by the French police. Others were captured in the barrage of tear gas laid down in the rail yards. Some ran for miles, but none reached the middle of the 30-mile tunnel -- where they would have met British officers with dogs. The incident prompted increased calls for the camp's closure. Donald G.

Hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians met at the barricades outside this embattled village today, but instead of bullets and stones the air was filled with hands lifting sacks of rice, bags of sugar and jugs of cooking oil. In a rare gesture in this weary land, more than 250 Israeli peace advocates delivered about two tons of food and clothing to 12,000 Palestinian residents of Beit Umar, which has been closed by the Israeli military blockade for more than a year.

From the charred and soggy streets of the empty Mesa Redonda shopping district to clogged and sun-baked sidewalks outside the central morgue, people were desperately clinging today to the old year. For many of them, the remaining hours offered the slimmest hope that their loved ones survived the fireworks explosions that sent fireballs racing through the narrow streets of the district on Saturday night, setting four blocks ablaze and killing nearly 300 people. Wilfredo Palomino spent the morning holding a fruitless vigil outside the morgue, where the line of relatives snaked down the busy block and onto the lawn. His wife, Rosa, had taken a job selling fireworks with one of the many street vendors in Mesa Redonda only last Friday, after he lost his tailor's job on Christmas Eve. Poverty cost her her life, her mother said, but he refused to believe it.

Eduardo Duhalde, a veteran Peronist politician with a strong populist streak, was chosen late tonight as Argentina's fifth president in less than two weeks. He immediately announced that he would form a ''government of national unity'' in a last-ditch effort to bring the country back from what he called ''the verge of disintegration and chaos.'' ''We're at the limit and we know it,'' he said after being sworn in to run the country until the end of 2003. Though he acknowledged that ''we have no external or domestic credit,'' he nevertheless promised to run a government that will carry out ''a more just distribution of riches.''

In the fall, the organizers of an annual summit meeting for the world's economic, political and academic leaders decided to move the conference from its usual site in Switzerland to New York City as a show of solidarity in the aftermath of the terror attacks. Security, the organizers were told by city and police officials of the Giuliani administration, would be little problem for a force accustomed to dealing with large-scale demonstrations. City and police officials of the Bloomberg administration have not backed off that pledge. But they acknowledge that the demonstrations expected during the World Economic Forum, to be held at the Waldorf-Astoria from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4, could be unlike any seen before in the city.

At the same time, it keeps laying claim to art's special powers and perks. One of its traditional selling points is objectivity. Yet it's a medium of calculation: of measured light and chosen angles, of zooming in and editing out. These opposites define its tensions. Such tensions can be felt even in an exhibition as anti-elitist and programmatically didactic as ''Hidden Truths: Bloody Sunday 1972'' at the International Center of Photography. The show doesn't pretend for an instant to be art. Most of its dozens of pictures are digital scans of umpteenth generation press prints, images made to be transferred to newsprint and valued for information, not formal finesse.

Freed from its link to the American dollar for the first time in nearly 11 years, the Argentine peso dropped sharply on foreign exchange markets here today as the government ended an emergency bank holiday that had halted normal economic activity since before Christmas. An initial wave of nervousness quickly drove down the peso's value to as low as 1.70 to the dollar on the open market, far from the fixed rate of one peso to one dollar that had prevailed before President Eduardo Duhalde was given sweeping economic powers on Sunday. The official exchange rate set then was 1.4 pesos to the dollar, but it applies almost exclusively to foreign trade transactions and is not available to individual Argentines.

For all the appearances of casual disorder, it is a fairly smooth operation. Having learned from the raucous past, the activists who are gathering in New York to protest the World Economic Forum have put into place a system that addresses everything from whom to call when in police custody to where to get the best vegetarian Thai food. There is an Internet forum for travel arrangements, and another for out-of-towners to find someplace to sleep. There are workshops on civil rights and rehearsals of certain chants, like ''We need a doctor!'' And for the last two nights, there have been the final ''spokes councils,'' at which representatives from dozens of organizations finalize plans for puppet performances, peaceful protests -- and mischief.

The world's most powerful policy makers and entrepreneurs, who have in the past used the World Economic Forum to promote the opportunities promised by technology and borderless commerce, seem more obsessed this year with their endless vulnerabilities. In seminar rooms and in the hallways of the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan this week, the men and women who once trekked to Davos, Switzerland, to talk about how the Internet could revolutionize life in Indian villages have spent much of the last few days discussing more prosaic concerns: Keeping their corporate headquarters secure, their chemical and biological materials out of the wrong hands, and how to best fight terrorism.

Trapped in Ramallah, on the West Bank, shadowed by Israeli tanks, Yasir Arafat often recalls his decades-long duel with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, visitors to his compound say. Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, considers himself the only Arab general to have beaten Mr. Sharon, one of Israel's most storied fighters. A dramatic high point in his narrative is the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Besieged in Beirut, Mr. Arafat and his men were forced to evacuate, while Israel became mired in Lebanon until it withdrew unilaterally in May 2000.

They came, they marched, they chanted (and a few landed in jail). But as the last of the rallies and teach-ins petered out yesterday afternoon, the demonstrators who came to New York to rail against the World Economic Forum expressed exhilaration, vindication and yet frustration, saying that their cause had produced larger-than-expected crowds and had defied predictions of violence -- but that their voices had fallen on largely indifferent ears. Still, after the ugly confrontations in Seattle and Genoa, Italy, organizers said that events in New York represented a turning point for a movement that has been so strongly associated with televised images of riot police and tear gas.

Sickmann has been rethinking his role in one of the first acts by Islamic extremists against the United States, on Nov. 4, 1979, when he was a Marine guard at the United States Embassy in Tehran. On orders from his superiors, Sergeant Sickmann did not so much as lob a tear gas grenade at the mob coming to occupy the embassy. Now he thinks he and his fellow guards should have started shooting.

As hundreds of Palestinian boys filled a schoolyard in the Arab village of Sur Bahir in southern Jerusalem this morning, the headmaster and two teachers noticed an unusual V-shaped contraption under a cluster of pine trees in a corner of the yard. They saw two metallic-looking gray cones, each about a foot and a half long, lying on their sides next to a round object, apparently a timer, that was partly covered with soil. The wide ends of the cones, sealed with styrofoam, were aimed at different parts of the schoolyard, where more than 400 boys, mostly junior high school students, were milling about.

Voters in Zimbabwe turned out today in what appeared to be record numbers for the first day of the country's long-awaited presidential election, hopeful that it would bring an end to years of political turmoil but fearful that it could touch off even more trouble. Here in the capital, voters encountered lines that stretched for hundreds of yards, and tonight the justice minister said that he was prepared to allow voting beyond Sunday if it became clear that more time would be needed to accommodate the ''unprecedented'' turnout.

IN the fever of Zimbabwe's recent presidential campaign, more than 20 opposition party supporters were killed while the authorities looked the other way. Officials eliminated polling stations in opposition strongholds, effectively disenfranchising thousands of voters, and the police fired choking clouds of tear gas to disperse hundreds more who were waiting to cast their ballots. Last week, President Robert Mugabe was declared the winner of the election, which was promptly condemned as illegitimate by President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and European election observers. But here in Africa, many leaders bent over backward to praise the election. South Africa's deputy president hailed it as ''free and fair.'' Election observers from Namibia said the outcome ''reflects the wishes of the people of Zimbabwe.'' The Organization of African Unity called it ''transparent and credible.''

Protests against Israel and the United States intensified across the Middle East today, with the police in Amman and Cairo firing water cannons and repeated bursts of tear gas to prevent demonstrators, mostly students, from surging through the streets. The protests took myriad forms. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein demanded that Arabs take the unlikely step of cutting off oil sales to the West. In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi led marchers through the streets of the capital, Tripoli, and challenged the Arab nations bordering Israel to open the frontiers to allow volunteer fighters to join the Palestinians.

Just after 2:30 this afternoon, the heavy iron gates of the University of Alexandria swung open and waves of angry students swept out into the street. At either end of the wide avenue that runs past the faded yellow brick of the law school, riot policemen in black helmets fingered their truncheons and shotguns and their sheathed bayonets. On Tuesday, at least one student was killed and 200 were injured when the police fired tear gas, buckshot and rubber bullets into a huge crowd of protesting students. It was one of the most violent confrontations between Egyptian protesters and the police in years.

Inside the Church of the Nativity, a dozen wounded Palestinian gunmen are being cared for by a nun in the back of the grotto, the site where Christians believe the Virgin Mary gave birth. Palestinian fighters walk around the basilica with assault rifles slung across their backs, sleeping on pews or on the floor when not on watch duty. And the monks and nuns generally keep to themselves, venturing from their monasteries into the church itself only two to three times a day to check the holy site, light oil lamps and conduct services.

A group of high-ranking generals broke ranks Thursday night to demand the resignation of President Hugo Chávez after at least 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when hundreds of thousands of protesters marched on the presidential palace. Among those who rebelled was the army commander, Gen. Efraín Vásquez Velasco. ''Mr. President, I was loyal to the end, but today's deaths cannot be tolerated,'' he said in a news conference this evening.

WITH Israeli machine-gun fire still slicing through the sour smell of tear gas in the air here, it is hard to imagine a time -- such a short time ago, really -- when Israelis and Palestinians talked about reconciliation without bitterness, or even irony. Now, despite a yearning on both sides for tranquillity -- maybe in part because of it -- suicide bombings and Israeli incursions have pretty much put an end to such talk, and perhaps even to the dream.

Even if you have never heard of James Nachtwey, the award-winning photojournalist who is the subject of Christian Frei's new documentary ''War Photographer,'' it is likely that you are familiar with his work. For more than two decades Mr. Nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war, famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating, eloquent clarity. He was in Nicaragua at the height of the contra war, in South Africa during the bloody mid-1980's and in Rwanda in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. Mr. Frei shows video clips from those places, and many of Mr. Nachtwey's memorable pictures, some of which are all the more haunting for suggesting, rather than showing, the extent of the cruelty and suffering he has seen. The most terrible image from Rwanda may be one in which neither killers nor victims appear, but one whose frame is filled by a pile of machetes. The film is less a retrospective than a profile of the photographer in action. It begins in the eerie silence of Kosovo in 1999 with Mr. Natchtwey turning his camera on burning farmhouses, grieving families and grave sites and follows him into the poorest sections of Jakarta, where homeless families live beside railroad tracks, and to the West Bank city of Ramallah in the early months of the current intifada.

At least two people were killed here today and dozens more injured and arrested when protesters demanding jobs and food clashed with police in the worst riots since political turmoil late last year helped topple Argentina's government. The public has grown increasingly impatient with the long-running and crippling economic crisis that is threatening President Eduardo Duhalde, whose Peronist party is allied with the groups that organized the protests. Mr. Duhalde came to power in January after riots in December that killed 27 people and brought down the government of Fernando de la Rúa. When appointed, Mr. Duhalde became Argentina's fifth president in less than two weeks.

It went by the title ''In Jaffa, We Talk,'' and it was meant to reinforce in wrenching times the theater's commitment to partnership between the Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel. At one point Igal Ezraty, the theater's artistic director, began to read aloud the names of the intifada's fatalities, and he asked the audience to stand in mourning. But when he mentioned several Israeli soldiers who were killed, some Arab spectators shouted back that they could not commemorate ''our oppressors, our murderers.''

ON the busy stretch of Huguenot Street here, the Chevrolet dealership and Pizza Hut mix easily with the New Roc City entertainment complex and a sprinkling of office buildings. It is the unlikely home for headquarters to one of the world's leading spy supply companies. CCS International, Ltd., the parent company of the Counter Spy Shops, has its showrooms, a factory, a training center and corporate offices there. Clients can view an array of security, surveillance and counter surveillance gadgetry: anti-bug alerts that vibrate silently in a pocket to inform the bearer that someone is secretly recording or transmitting conversations; package and letter bomb detectors; personal protection gear ranging from gas masks to bulletproof clothing; and hand-held radar probes that ''see'' contraband through walls.

Hundreds of women blocked the gates of Chevron Texaco and Shell offices in separate protests aimed at forcing community development aid and other concessions from oil multinationals in southern Nigeria, company officials said today. The protests were like incidents last month that paralyzed Chevron Texaco's Nigeria operations for two weeks. As in those, groups of women gathered outside offices in the southern port of Warri and prevented workers from entering or leaving the premises of the two companies for several hours on Thursday.

The Supreme Court of Venezuela today dismissed the case against four military officers the government had accused of rebelling against President Hugo Chávez in April. The ruling set off violent protests by supporters of the president in the streets of the capital. By a vote of 11 to 8, the justices held that the four officers -- the former commander of the army, two navy admirals and an air force general -- should not stand trial on charges they had risen up against the government on April 11, temporarily forcing Mr. Chávez from power. He returned to office two days later when his supporters rose up against an interim government that replaced him.

The light gray gas filtered down like a mist in the theater hall before sunrise on Saturday, and the effect on hostages and hostage-takers alike was nearly instant. Most simply lost consciousness, as their breath and blood slowed and Russian security troops began to surge through the theater. Some of Russia's top health officials said tonight that the gas was a nonlethal anesthetic, like the ones used in general surgery. But in the chaos of a predawn commando operation against heavily armed guerrillas, the result was all too lethal. Of the 117 hostages confirmed dead so far, all but one appear to have died from the effects of the gas, according to the Health Committee of Moscow.

The number of hostages who died as a result of a raid on a Moscow theater jumped to 117 today, as more people succumbed to the effects of a debilitating gas that Russian security forces used as they stormed the building being held by Chechen guerrillas. The mounting number of dead, from among more than 750 hostages, cast a deep shadow over a predawn raid that the authorities had at first hailed as a successful operation. Also darkening the mood were disclosures that doctors were almost completely unprepared to treat the hostages for gas-related problems.

American officials said yesterday that they suspected the Russian security police who raided a Moscow theater early Saturday might have used an aerosol version of a powerful, fast-acting opiate called Fentanyl to knock out Chechen extremists and prevent them from killing the 750 hostages they were holding.

Russia's use of a dangerous incapacitating gas to knock out Chechen terrorists who had seized more than 750 hostages at a Moscow theater has underscored the urgent need to develop safer methods to immobilize hostage takers without harming their hostages. The powerful gas, which was pumped in through the theater's ventilation system, killed at least 116 of the hostages and sent hundreds more to the hospital. Whether the high death toll was deemed acceptable collateral damage or was the result of a terrible miscalculation is not known. Russia needs to provide fuller details on the assault and its harm to the hostages. Such information could help this country and others prepare to deal with future terrorist takeovers. The agent used against the Chechen terrorists was most likely an aerosol version of a potent, fast-acting opiate called Fentanyl that is used as an anesthetic for horses. Whatever the specific chemical, it falls into the category of incapacitating agents, which are supposed to be nonlethal.

The police fired tear gas to break up demonstrations by thousands of antigovernment protesters, as President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's supporters used whips and hurled rocks to drive away government opponents. At least 14 people were reported injured. Two men were shot by Aristide backers in the town of Petit-Goâve, where the police lobbed tear gas canisters into about 2,000 marchers, witnesses said. Thousands more protested in cities including the capital, Port-au-Prince. Those protests were stopped.

Daniel arap Moi, supreme ruler of Kenya for 24 years and one of Africa's longest surviving leaders, is ceding power this month in an election that many see as a test not only of this spirited if struggling country, but of the viability of democracy across the continent. Mr. Moi arrives in Washington on Thursday for a meeting with President Bush, one that is expected to touch on both the Nov. 28 terrorist attacks in Mombasa and the importance of the looming transition in Kenya. If all goes well and Mr. Moi steps gracefully aside, Mr. Bush is planning a trip to Kenya early next year, with one possible stop being the newly constructed American Embassy in Nairobi, which replaces the one destroyed by a terrorist bombing in 1998.

Government opponents said tonight that they were extending a paralyzing general strike into a fourth day, possibly damaging informal agreements made earlier today between the government and its foes in discussions mediated by the Organization of American States, people involved in the talks said. The strike by Venezuelan businessmen and workers opposed to the left-leaning government of President Hugo Chávez threatens to cripple the Venezuelan economy, Latin America's fourth largest, and disrupt oil supplies to the United States. This evening, the captain of a tanker carrying 280,000 barrels of refined gasoline for the domestic market told a Venezuelan television network he was anchoring his ship in the middle of the Lake Maracaibo shipping channel, possibly blocking a key route for oil tankers.

President Hugo Chávez may have thought the gravest threat to his rule had passed in April, when four days of swelling protests temporarily removed him from power. But at that time he faced a hodgepodge of opponents without a central goal. His opposition was unfocused and fractured -- united not even in what it wanted or what methods to use to shorten the presidency of a mercurial leader whose left-leaning policies have antagonized opponents certain he is leading their country to ruin.

The bombing that shattered windows and lodged shrapnel in the walls of Genoa's police headquarters last Monday reminded many Italians of the fighting between the police and antiglobalization protesters at the Group of 8 summit meeting there last year. The purported bombers even offered a mnemonic device to jog the country's memory. The little-known July 20 Brigade, which claimed responsibility for the two explosions, is named for the date last year on which a police officer shot dead a young rioter, a day when smashed storefront glass blanketed the sidewalks and tear gas filled the air.

In an election that was widely viewed as a referendum on India's secular character, Hindu nationalists won a landslide re-election victory today in the western state of Gujarat, which was convulsed by Hindu-Muslim riots early this year. The vote seemed to affirm the success of the campaign strategy of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party, which had focused on uniting Hindus against a threat of Islamic terrorism and implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, against the state's Muslims.

The ground was littered with broken glass, a few gunshots had been fired, and the army was popping tear gas to forestall a riot (though Venezuelan gas is wimpish stuff, like onion-scented air freshener).

Today was a day of waiting in Kenya in queues that stretched down city blocks, through rural fields, down the muddy paths of the slums. Many Kenyans were up at dawn to cast their ballots in East Africa's most widely anticipated election in a generation, a vote that offered many their first true choice after 24 years of rule by President Daniel arap Moi. There were scenes of the violence and blatant vote rigging that have marred previous elections here. But by and large it was a day of muted rejoicing that Kenya, which under Mr. Moi has suffered an economic nosedive and become notoriously corrupt, might receive a fresh start under a new leader.

Aicha el-Wafi, mother of the accused terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, has just finished a crème caramel and is on her way out of a restaurant in Narbonne, France, when a waiter stops her. ''I saw your son the other day on television,'' he says. ''He was very good -- very interesting.'' He's not referring to Zacarias, who is being held in isolation in Virginia, charged with conspiracy in the Sept. 11 attacks. The waiter is talking about her other son, Abd-Samad Moussaoui, author of ''Zacarias, My Brother: The Making of a Terrorist,'' an account of his younger brother's life until 1995, when Zacarias was 27, after which the two fell permanently out of touch. Neither Abd-Samad nor the boys' mother knew what had become of Zacarias until Sept. 12, 2001, when the television news started flashing a mug shot of the man thought to be the ''20th hijacker.'' His head was shaved, and his face had gotten beefier, but the Moussaoui family knew it was Zacarias. ''You think it was very interesting?'' el-Wafi says with an engaging smile. Dressed in a camel's hair coat and leopard-print scarf, she shifts her weight to a more comfortable stance; she might be there awhile. Her tone shifts as well, taking on an edge. ''You think it was very impressive? You think it was 'très bien'? Let me ask you something: Is that what you would do if your brother was in jail? Would you write a book telling the world your brother is a racist, an extremist, denouncing your brother, complaining about your mother? Is that what you would do?''

Striking police officers and civilian protesters clashed with government troops today, leaving at least 10 people dead, 53 injured and the ruling party headquarters and the main jail in flames here in the capital. Government troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition at the demonstrators, who stormed the presidential palace to protest government proposals to raise taxes and cut spending on social programs.

Confronting America's countdown to war, throngs of chanting, placard-waving demonstrators converged on New York and scores of cities across the United States, Europe and Asia yesterday in a global daisy chain of largely peaceful protests against the Bush administration's threatened invasion of Iraq. Three years after vast crowds turned out around the world to celebrate the new millennium, millions gathered again yesterday in a darker mood of impending conflict, forming a patchwork of demonstrations that together, organizers said, made up the largest, most diverse peace protest since the Vietnam War.

TEN years ago, a 20-year-old New Yorker named Lee Hirsch left for Johannesburg with $600 in his pocket and the phone numbers of two local contacts. Mr. Hirsch was on a mission: he had become obsessed with the popular music that had sprung up around the antiapartheid movement, and he was determined to make a film about it. If his undertaking seemed quixotic -- Mr. Hirsch was white, had never before been to South Africa and had no previous research to guide him -- well, he thought, so be it. ''The music just grabbed me,'' said Mr. Hirsch, now 30, in his Upper West Side apartment. ''There was an urgency in the music that appealed to me, and I wanted to learn more, I wanted to hear more.''

The difference is that while Eriksson was excoriated for his novel approach in using 22 players, changing the entire team after 45 minutes, in a friendly against Australia on Feb. 12, Bradley has little choice if he wants to get a good look at the 29 players on his bulging roster less than two months before the start of Major League Soccer's eighth season.

An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said. The Israeli military said the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the woman, and called it a ''very regrettable accident.'' The woman, Rachel Corrie, 23, from Olympia, Wash., was among eight Americans and Britons who had been acting has ''human shields'' to try to stop the almost daily house demolitions by Israeli forces in Rafah, a town on Gaza's border with Egypt. When the bulldozer approached a house today, Ms. Corrie, who was wearing a bright orange jacket, dropped to her knees, a practice that members of the group to which she belonged, the International Solidarity Movement, have used repeatedly, her colleagues at the scene said. As the bulldozer reached her without slowing up, she began to rise, but was trapped beneath a pile of dirt generated by its blade and the blade itself, said one member of the group, Tom Dale, who said he was standing about 30 feet away. ''We were shouting and waving our arms at the driver,'' said Mr. Dale, who is British. ''We even had a megaphone. But the bulldozer kept going until she was under the body or the tracks of the bulldozer.'' The bulldozer stopped for a few seconds and pulled back, Mr. Dale added. Her colleagues rushed to Ms. Corrie, who was bleeding from the head and face and badly wounded, but still breathing. An ambulance took her to Najar Hospital, where she died. She had a fractured skull and other injuries, said Dr. Ali Moussa, a hospital administrator. At the time Ms. Corrie was run over, she was in an open area in front of the house, Mr. Dale said. The bulldozer came from some distance away, and ''there was nothing to obscure the driver's view,'' he said. But Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman, said that the armored bulldozer had small windows and limited visibility, and that the driver had not been aware that Ms. Corrie was in his path. In a statement, the Israeli military said soldiers ''were dealing with a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger -- the Palestinians, themselves and our forces -- by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone.'' About an hour before Ms. Corrie was killed, troops fired tear gas and shot into the air during a confrontation with the protesters at a nearby house, both Mr. Dale and the Israeli military said. The International Solidarity Movement is made up mostly of Americans and Europeans in their 20's and 30's who are sympathetic to the Palestinians and oppose the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They have repeatedly placed themselves in front of Israeli forces operating in those areas. Last May, several members dashed past Israeli troops into the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Palestinian gunmen had been holed up for more than a month. The protesters remained for several days, until the standoff ended with the surrender of the gunmen. Ms. Corrie, who was to graduate from the Evergreen State College in Olympia this year, had been in Rafah for two months, living with Palestinians in areas where homes were being demolished, her colleagues said. In Olympia, Colin Reese, a student at Evergreen State and a close friend of Ms. Corrie, said she had focused much of her studies on community organizing. Describing her work in Gaza, he said, ''She was particularly touched by the Palestinian situation and wanted to use her privilege as an American citizen to help defend against the Israeli occupation.'' One of Ms. Corrie's teachers at Evergreen was Larry Mosqueda, a professor of political economy and social change, who said her work in Gaza was a reflection of lessons taught at Evergreen that encourage students to put their education to practical use while still in college. ''She has a strong sense of social justice,'' he said. ''Basically, she wanted to do something about it instead of just talk about it.'' In an e-mail message this month, Ms. Corrie described a Feb. 14 standoff in which members of her group ''stood in the path of the bulldozers and were physically pushed with the shovel backwards, taking shelter in a house.'' She added that ''the bulldozer then proceeded on its course, demolishing one side of the house'' with the protesters still inside. The Israeli Army and Palestinian militants wage frequent gun battles in Rafah. An unarmed Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli fire today in the town, said Palestinian security sources and hospital officials. The Israeli Army said it was checking the report. The military has flattened dozens of homes in Rafah, some because militants were using them for cover. The Israeli authorities have said the International Solidarity Movement's protesters prevent soldiers from acting against militants, and they have deported some members. Demonstrators have been hurt on a number of occasions, but Ms. Corrie was the first one killed. The Israeli troops ''have shot over our heads, and shot near our feet -- they have fired tear gas at us,'' said Michael Shaik, media coordinator for the group. ''But we thought we had an understanding. We didn't think they would kill us.''

The characters in George P. Pelecanos's proletarian crime novels all work hard for a living, but none of the honest entrepreneurs in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington run their operations with the ruthless efficiency of the gun merchants and drug dealers in SOUL CIRCUS (Little, Brown, $24.95). With the territorial gang lord Granville Oliver out of commission and on trial for his life, business ethics dictate that two rival gangs should beef up their arsenals and fight it out for his drug trade. To the despair of Derek Strange, Pelecanos's salt-of-the-earth private investigator, more children are recruited for the gang war, and the only person who really benefits is Ulysses Foreman, the local gun dealer and an expert in supply and demand. ''Long as kids down here had no fathers and were looking to belong to something,'' Foreman says, ''then there was gonna be gangs and a need for guns.'' Pelecanos is fascinated with the way things work, and he takes apart the gun trade like an urban anthropologist, fitting the pieces into the drug business and the gang culture with an exactness that is breathtaking -- and depressing. At the same time, he treats his criminals like human beings, talking their talk, driving their cars, listening to their music, getting into their world with something that can only be called sympathy.

President Bush has authorized American military forces to use tear gas in Iraq, the Pentagon says, a development that some weapons experts say other countries might see as a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Defense Department said tear gas, which has been issued to American troops, would be used only to save civilian lives and in accordance with the convention, ratified by the United States in 1997. But critics say any battlefield use of tear gas would violate the treaty, offend crucial allies, including Britain, and hand Saddam Hussein a possible pretext for using chemical weapons against the United States.

FOR certain Americans, the Black Panthers, one the most potent revolutionary groups of the late 1960's, were very over by 1970. That was the year Tom Wolfe's ''Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers'' appeared. His account of media-savvy young African-Americans wearing berets and shades and hustling a scam, and of rich white types (Leonard Bernstein, Carter Burden) tripping all over themselves in support, was the Panther story people had been waiting for: a Rowan and Martin ''Laugh-In'' skit. A spoof, a circus, a farce. Mortified, the haute bourgeois Left turned off its largesse. The Panthers dropped in status from superstars to superfluous. ''Delicious,'' purred The Wall Street Journal of Mr. Wolfe's caustic little neo-conservative classic. The mainstream press did nothing to help Black Panther Party credibility. The party's membership, and its neighborhood-based food and medical programs, grew. So did F.B.I. surveillance and infiltration. (J. Edgar Hoover called the Panthers ''the greatest threat to the internal security of the United States.'')

Soldiers opened fire on protesting students at a university in the southern city of Puno, while in the city of Arequipa, the police fired tear gas at striking teachers. In Lima, police officers in riot gear chased striking judiciary workers at the National Justice building. Teachers, demanding a pay raise, began a nationwide strike two weeks ago, and demonstrations gradually escalated to include farmers, court workers and other sectors. After the emergency decree, some farmers and health workers suspended their strikes, but court workers and teachers vowed to press on.

President Bush stepped onto French soil today to meet the European leaders who vociferously opposed the war in Iraq, but rather than rehash their differences he spent the day trying to increase pressure on two other nations he regards as major threats -- Iran and North Korea -- to give up their nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Bush arrived here from St. Petersburg, Russia, after a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin that both men used to put differences over Iraq behind them, and to sign the recently ratified treaty that requires both sides to reduce their nuclear arsenals.

A former Venezuelan general whose visa was revoked by the Bush administration had been advocating the overthrow of President Hugo Chávez, American officials said today. The United States has publicly opposed the president's overthrow, urging that his fate be settled by democratic means. The visa of the former general, Enrique Medina, was rescinded by the State Department in May on the recommendation of the American Embassy in Venezuela, a State Department official said by phone from Washington. Mr. Medina, a former attaché in the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, led a group of dissident generals who have for months gathered in a Caracas neighborhood opposed to Mr. Chávez and loudly called for his ouster.

A leading human rights group today accused United States troops of using excessive force in two April shootings that killed 20 Iraqis and wounded at least 86. Commanders said their soldiers were responding to hostile fire from a crowd of protesters in Falluja, a city of 300,000 about 35 miles west of Baghdad. The group, Human Rights Watch, said researchers found few bullet holes that would suggest that the crowd of protesters fired on the soldiers using a school as a base. But they found more than 100 bullet holes on seven buildings across the street. The evidence, the report said, was inconsistent with American statements that the soldiers responded with ''precision fire'' when they were allegedly attacked.

A clash this week between Rio de Janeiro riot police and some 15,000 desperate unemployed people jostling to sign up for jobs as street sweepers and garbage collectors was a stark sign that President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva needs to take swift action to get Brazil's sputtering economy growing again. Since taking office nearly six months ago, Mr. da Silva, the left-leaning former metalworker, has been steering a tricky course between inflation and recession, raising interest rates to four-year highs to keep consumer prices under control but trying not to push them so high as to stop the economy dead in its tracks.

The police in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, sprayed a chemical substance last night to disperse thousands of fans waiting outside the already-packed volleyball arena before the Pan American Games gold medal game between Cuba and the Dominican Republic. The Dominican women won the match in five sets, 15-13 in the fifth, after blowing a two-set lead. The arena, which holds about 8,000 people, was nearly full two hours earlier as the United States women beat Brazil for the bronze medal. When that match ended, fans were sitting in aisles and on the floor, and armed police officers and militia members were walking through the building with guard dogs.

The police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters who attacked government buildings in the southwestern city of Khulna after the killing of an opposition politician.

He was riding in a rickshaw when he was attacked outside his house. The rickshaw driver was also killed.

The lure of playing in the UEFA Cup and in the new 48,000-seat City of Manchester Stadium, not to mention a more lucrative contract, was enough for CLAUDIO REYNA to turn his back on Fulham and jump to Manchester City.

Israel's vice prime minister said today that killing Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was one of several options now under government consideration. His remarks came as a beaming Mr. Arafat soaked up the cheers of supporters who descended on his compound for a fourth consecutive day. ''Arafat can no longer be a factor in what happens here,'' the vice prime minister, Ehud Olmert, told the Israel radio. ''The question is: How are we going to do it? Expulsion is certainly one of the options, and killing is also one of the options.''

Twenty-two inmates have sued the state, saying it allowed prison guards to torture them in their cells by spraying them with pepper spray and tear gas. In a federal lawsuit filed on Friday in Fort Myers, the inmates said the use of chemical agents by prison guards had greatly increased. They say the practice violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Lisa White Shirley, a lawyer for Florida Institutional Legal Services, which is representing the inmates, said that because the inmates sprayed were in their cells they generally did not pose a danger and that the spraying was done as retaliation, punishment or intimidation.

Workers participating in a 24-hour national strike protesting what they say is mismanagement of the social security fund clashed with riot police officers on the paralyzed streets of the country's two largest cities. According to reports from Panama City and the port of Colón, protesters numbering in the tens of thousands threw rocks and gasoline bombs at the police, who returned fire with rubber bullets and tear gas. The strike was the first nationwide work stoppage in six years. Union leaders called it after the government dismissed the head of the heavily indebted fund, which covers health care and retirement. They accuse the government of mismanaging the fund to the point of bankruptcy. David Gonzalez (NYT)

Thousands of demonstrators marched in Bolivia's capital and other nearby cities on Monday, calling for the president's resignation. But they were dispersed by military units firing tear gas canisters, and at a midafternoon news conference President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was defiant and pugnacious. ''I'm not going anywhere,'' he said, citing his determination to remain in office and vowing that ''order will be restored.'' He added, ''It is not possible that democracy be replaced by a dictatorship of the unions'' that will ''pit region against region, class against class and ethnic group against ethnic group.''

Tomorrow is the 36th anniversary of a riot at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The police use of tear gas to subdue rebellious college students made it memorable, but at the heart of the event was a different chemical: napalm. The Dow Chemical Company (''Our position on the manufacture of napalm is that we are a supplier of goods to the Defense Department and not a policy maker'') had sent a recruiter to the campus. His very presence was enough to set off a violent uproar. His name was William L. Hendershot, known as Curly. He had brought a ham sandwich for lunch.

On a rain-soaked October night in Miami, the police have commandeered downtown. It is midnight, and patrol cars cordon off the streets of run-down delis and dollar stores. Dozens of black-clad officers maneuver and bullhorn in the distance, practicing their tactics. ''We're expecting about 70,000 to 100,000 protesters to come down here in November,'' says a beat cop, guarding a corner from his squad car. ''Our guys are doing exercises all around.'' A few blocks over, at a red light, Lisa Fithian pulls her compact rental car behind a squadron of city police cruisers. Hers is one of the few civilian cars in this area, certainly the only one carrying an advance guard of that human wave heading for Miami. While most people have been ushered out of the downtown area, the 42-year-old Fithian wants to go into it, to do reconnaissance with three fellow activists. Weeks from now, she will be marching in these streets, and the police will no longer be practicing. Since it is difficult to find our way about, Fithian decides, boldly, to follow the cruisers. ''You know,'' she says, ''it's kind of nice to tail the cops for once.''

The memorandum, which the bureau sent to local law enforcement agencies last month in advance of antiwar demonstrations in Washington and San Francisco, detailed how protesters have sometimes used ''training camps'' to rehearse for demonstrations, the Internet to raise money and gas masks to defend against tear gas. The memorandum analyzed lawful activities like recruiting demonstrators, as well as illegal activities like using fake documentation to get into a secured site.

One person was killed and several others injured in a clash between the police, supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and antigovernment marchers near the American Consulate in Port-au-Prince. Demonstrators had gathered outside the consulate, where they burned a coffin and called for the ouster of Mr. Aristide. As the demonstrators were leaving, rock-throwing Aristide supporters confronted them. The police fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Hospital officials said the man who was killed died when he was struck in the chest by a tear-gas canister. A spokeswoman for the consulate said the office closed because of the unrest but that officials hoped to re-open it today. Richard Lezin Jones (NYT)

At 24, David Jonathas is barely old enough to remember the political revolution that eventually placed a Catholic priest named Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the presidential palace. And yet, Mr. Jonathas hopes to be part of another movement, equal in determination to that earlier campaign waged in the late 1980's but with opposite results. ''As long as Aristide is in power, there will be no democracy,'' said Mr. Jonathas, a student at the University of Haiti, wiping his brow moments after he and a few hundred other students finished a march through the winding, pockmarked streets of the capital here calling for Mr. Aristide's ouster. ''He must go. We need a new system.''

A suspect in a shooting spree that wounded nine people at a Brooklyn diner last month was found dead, apparently a suicide, in an Albany apartment Wednesday afternoon after being surrounded by the police, the authorities said yesterday. After the suspect, Ramel Simmons, 23, had been tracked to the apartment, New York City and Albany police officers arrived to arrest him, the police said. After no response to police calls for two hours, tear gas was fired inside, and a fiber-optic camera showed Mr. Simmons dead on the floor with a 9-millimeter handgun, the police said. It is unclear whether Mr. Simmons shot himself before the police arrived or after the tear gas was used, the police said. The police had identified Mr. Simmons as one of two men who opened fire in the Galaxy Diner in East New York on Jan. 17, sending customers diving under tables for cover before taking jewelry and money and fleeing. Another suspect, Mark Blount of East New York, was arrested the following week. The police are seeking a third suspect, possibly a driver, an investigator said. Michael Wilson (NYT)

WHEN George W. Bush's handlers had him dress up as the 1986 Tom Cruise of ''Top Gun'' to dance a victory jig on an aircraft carrier, they didn't stop to think that he might soon face an opponent who could be type-cast more persuasively in his own Tom Cruise role. John F. Kerry was in real life a comrade of Ron Kovic, whom Mr. Cruise played to great acclaim in the 1989 ''Born on the Fourth of July.'' Mr. Kerry, like the movie's hero, was a decorated Vietnam soldier who became a star activist for Vietnam Veterans Against the War upon returning home. In a pivotal scene in the film, delegates at the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach eject Kovic and his fellow protesting vets from the hall, call him a traitor and spit on him. If that incident has a certain angry passion, it may be because the director was Oliver Stone. Like both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry, Mr. Stone was a son of privilege who attended Yale in the mid-1960's. Like Mr. Kerry but unlike Mr. Bush, he went on to combat in Vietnam, won a bronze star and then turned against America's most disastrous foreign war.

An international court opened a hearing on Monday about the Israeli barrier being built in and around the West Bank, as pro-Palestinian demonstrators here voiced encouragement in front of worried supporters of Israel. In a three-hour presentation to the International Court of Justice, the Palestinian Authority argued that the partly built barrier of ditches, watchposts and concrete walls was a violation of international law and an attempt to annex Palestinian land.

The world is now watching what is going on in Haiti. Everyone has seen how the population of Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, welcomed as liberators a motley group of rebels who now vow to march here to the capital. But that's only the most obvious sign of a resentment against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that has been growing for years. The most popular song of the Carnival that just ended, for example, was an attack on a government official, ''Madan Gougou,'' and by extension, on Mr. Aristide's Lavalas party. Schoolchildren pass around unflattering caricatures of the president, and anti-Aristide graffiti have proliferated in the streets. That's why Haitians weren't surprised when the democratic opposition, with no ties to the rebels, this week rejected an American-drafted proposal that would give it more power but also let President Aristide complete his term in office. The only solution, the opposition said, was for Mr. Aristide to go.

Iraq's most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has warned of ''dangerous consequences'' if the United Nations endorses the American-sponsored interim constitution for an independent Iraq that was adopted over Shiite protests two weeks ago. The warning came in a letter released by Ayatollah Sistani's office on Monday, four days after it was delivered in New York to Lakhtar Brahimi, the chief United Nations envoy to Iraq. It amounted to a warning that the ayatollah's followers, by far the most powerful political bloc in Iraq, could move to paralyze American plans for a smooth transfer of sovereignty on June 30 unless Shiite terms for changing the interim constitution were met.

Violent clashes erupted on the streets of Abidjan, the commercial capital of Ivory Coast, on Thursday, killing 25 people, prompting rebels to withdraw from a power-sharing government and raising new doubts about the prospects for disarmament. Ivory Coast was once an oasis of stability in West Africa, but the outbreak of war in September 2002 left the country partitioned between government and rebel-held territories. Under a French-brokered peace accord, rebels and opposition parties joined a government of national reconciliation, French troops monitored a cease-fire between the warring parties, and plans were under way to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force.

Thousands of people, most of them belonging to the city's minority Christian population, cowered in army barracks and police stations as mobs attacked people outside. Witnesses said dozens more had been killed.

For the first time since the return of civilian democracy in his home country, Wole Soyinka, the once-exiled Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate, took part in a political protest in the capital, Lagos. He received a mixed welcome. A crowd of hundreds turned up with banners and trumpets Saturday morning. Then, according to demonstrators, the police lobbed tear gas and whisked Mr. Soyinka away to a police station, only to release him less than an hour later and offer apologies for the trouble.

Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili -- called Misha by just about everyone in the country -- took power on Nov. 22, 2003, by storming Parliament on live national television. Yelling from the back benches, he ordered Eduard Shevardnadze, who was widely seen as having stolen the recent parliamentary elections, to step aside. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister and custodian of Georgia's descent into poverty and lawlessness, seemed frozen, then shaken by Saakashvili's rhetorical fire. As Shevardnadze was shuttled out the backdoor, Saakashvili, who had served a contentious term as justice minister under Shevardnadze, marched to the lectern, scanned the riotous scene, found the cameras and drank Shevardnadze's tall glass of tea. Out in the streets, protesters stuck flowers in the barrels of soldiers' assault rifles, and the Rose Revolution, as it was called, was over. Saakashvili, a charismatic 36-year-old graduate of Columbia Law School, was elected president two months later, winning 97 percent of the vote. Georgia -- a nation cracked open by three breakaway regions, racked by corruption and a tsunami of crime, reeling from two civil wars, pocked by constant electricity and water shortages and unable to collect taxes from its citizens -- was his to govern.

When Israeli soldiers opened an exhibit this month documenting some of their own misdeeds while serving in the tense West Bank city of Hebron, they caused a brief stir. At a photographic institute in Tel Aviv, the soldiers, all recently discharged, offer video testimony of gratuitous harassment and abuse of Palestinians, like firing tear gas just to get a reaction. Hanging on the wall are dozens of car keys confiscated from Hebron residents, a punishment both common and unauthorized, soldiers say. And a photo taken by a soldier shows graffiti, presumably written by civilians, which reads, ''Arabs to the gas chambers.''

I recently was invited to the Pentagon to watch a film depicting field tests of a new weapons program called the Active Denial System, which, it occurred to me, could have been named by an unhinged cognitive therapist. The live-action video opened on a vista reminiscent of Iraq or Afghanistan. Scattered amid the scrub of a desert plain, angry demonstrators howl unintelligible slogans and advance menacingly on a handful of soldiers who nervously pivot their rifles back and forth trying to deter the mob. For safety's sake during this test run, the ''crowd'' -- played for the most part by off-duty soldiers -- flings bright green tennis balls at the uniformed servicemen instead of rocks. As one member of the crowd hurls a ball, a soldier operating the Active Denial System (it looks like a squat satellite dish) targets an unruly protester in the weapon's viewfinder, squeezes a trigger that releases a beam of energy and, in a split second, one ''civilian'' howls and scampers away, fanning his rear end. Other demonstrators suffer similar fates, yelping and fleeing in panic, as if they have encountered a wall of invisible fire. After tumbling backward, the horde spins around, pointing and hollering like a Stone Age tribe encountering modern weaponry for the first time. What they were feeling was a blast of electromagnetic energy that causes a great deal of pain but does no lasting harm. That, in essence, is the point of a new generation of nonlethal weapons being developed by the military: to enforce and do battle without killing, or in the words of the Defense Department, ''to incapacitate personnel or matériel, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel and undesired damage to property and the environment.'' Along with the Active Denial System, the military is testing bullets that disintegrate in mid-air, propelling their nonlethal payload to their targets, slimy goo that stops people in their tracks and, eventually, guns that shoot pulses of plasma energy that stun and disorient.

After the Holocaust, racial apartheid in South Africa may be the 20th-century curse most people would identify as unequivocally evil. And the first half hour of ''Stander,'' which tells the true story of Andre Stander (Tom Jane), the notorious Johannesburg police captain who turned against a system he found repugnant, plays like a smoothly executed if predictable drama of one man's heroic rebellion. But just when you begin to relax and wait for the usual buttons to be pushed, ''Stander'' swerves in a more uncertain direction. The issue of apartheid recedes, and the film, which opens today in New York, becomes an unsettling character study camouflaged as a heist movie. The further the volatile title character evolves into a swaggering self-styled Robin Hood, the more his nobility begins to tarnish. By the end of the film, his demons have taken over, and he has become a compulsively self-destructive outlaw addicted to flouting authority.

An angry mob set fire to a passenger train, and protesters clashed with the police across Bangladesh on Sunday, leaving dozens of people injured, as violence spread a day after a grenade attack on an opposition rally killed 19 people and wounded hundreds. The train, the Subarna Express, was attacked as it was entering a station in the town of Bhairab, 50 miles east of its destination of Dhaka, the capital, said Mostafa-e-Jamail, a spokesman for state-run Bangladesh Railways. About 20 people were injured, most of them passengers trying to flee while protesters angry about the attack on Saturday doused at least 15 of about 25 train cars with gas and ignited them, the police said. Police officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.

In scenes reminiscent of Zimbabwe's land seizures, angry Masai tribesmen have begun marching onto sprawling ranches held by white settlers in Kenya's lush Rift Valley and claiming the tracts as their own. But while President Robert Mugabe backed -- and even encouraged -- the forced redistribution of land in Zimbabwe as a way of righting colonial wrongs, the Kenyan authorities are rebuffing the recent trespasses by the Masai.

Angered by the national government's plans to change local boundaries, this rundown resort of 36,000 people on the shores of Lake Ohrid is preparing to declare independence. The town's crusade, however quixotic, to become a city-state has struck a chord across Macedonia. That is because the boundary changes are part of a delicate peace arrangement that ended fighting between Albanian guerrillas and government security forces three years ago, when the country was on the brink of a civil war.

But for all the anger of the demonstrations, they have barely interrupted the convention narrative, and have drawn relatively little national news coverage. Using large orange nets to divide and conquer, and a near-zero tolerance policy for activities that even suggest the prospect of disorder, the New York Police Department has developed what amounts to a pre-emptive strike policy, cutting off demonstrations before they grow large enough, loud enough, or unruly enough to affect the convention.

The Bethel Woods Center, where ground was broken in July, is to open on July 1, 2006, with an inaugural concert by the New York Philharmonic. It is to have a 4,800-seat pavilion with lawn seating for 12,000. FILM PROTEST -- The new Pedro Almodóvar film, ''Bad Education,'' which deals with the sexual molestation of a young boy by a Roman Catholic priest, has come under attack in Poland, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. In Warsaw, where the movie opened on Friday, posters were defaced with graffiti, and in the town of Poznan, tear gas was lobbed into a theater, according to Malgorzata Kostro-Olechowska, a spokeswoman for Gutek Film, the distributor. She said that despite the attacks, the film would not be withdrawn, ''as we don't consider that it is against the church.'' ''Bad Education'' is to be shown at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 9 and 10.

Floodwaters receded Friday in this city where flooding from a tropical storm took more than 1,000 lives, leaving behind thousands of tired and hungry people who labored to clear the mud and debris from what was left of their homes. United Nations officials managed to distribute more than 40 tons of corn, flour and water in two of the hardest-hit neighborhoods of the city, Raboteau and Bienac, avoiding the mob scenes that have hampered aid efforts in recent days. But the United Nations soldiers at Raboteau used tear gas and fire shots in the air to control the crowd in the afternoon, witnesses said.

Allen's bleakly fascinating book tells the story of a veterans' crusade for compensation during World War I.	'The Bonus Army' 'An American Epic' By Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen. Illustrated. 370 pages. Walker & Company. $27. Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen began their prodigious research project on the Bonus Army of 1930's America with a nagging question: ''How could this all be forgotten?'' Certainly the events the authors sought to describe were well known in their day. These were the repeated marches on Washington by aging World War I veterans who had been promised federal funds in recognition of their wartime sacrifice. These veterans came home as heroes only to discover, in the words of one historian, that ''the Keys to the City had turned out only to be a pass to the flophouse.'' In 1924, the returning soldiers had been promised government recompense for the time they had spent overseas. By the early 1930's, with the nation in the throes of the Great Depression, this issue took on added urgency. There were veterans who had given up their main sources of income in order to enlist. They came back jobless, unable to pay their taxes and in danger of losing their homes.

At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?	WHEN Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard, theorized last month at a conference on ''Diversifying the Science and Engineering Work Force'' that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude, he could scarcely have anticipated the protests that unfolded last week on the university's campus. While the Coalition for an Anti-Sexist Harvard rallied outside the science center, a hastily formed group with the laid-back name Students for Larry was milling about Lowell Lecture Hall. But the crisis wasn't just about Larry Summers. Gendergate -- to give the scandal its obligatory suffix -- was more than a matter of an impolitic president. At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?

Demonstrators protested Sunday against Togo's new president, lighting flaming barricades in the capital's streets and throwing rocks at riot police officers who fired tear gas to keep crowds from moving toward government buildings. Demonstrators said the unannounced march was prompted by anger at the selection on Friday of Bonfoh Abbas as interim president of Togo until nationwide elections can be held in the coming months. Mr. Abbas, the deputy speaker of Parliament, was named interim president in a special session of Congress after Faure Gnassingbé stepped down. He had been installed as president after the death of his father, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who ruled as strongman for nearly four decades.

Rival gangs armed with guns, knives and machetes and battling for dominance in a prison in the Dominican Republic set a fire early Monday that swept through a crowded cellblock, killing at least 133 inmates and injuring 26, the authorities said. The fight in the prison in Higüey, 90 miles east of Santo Domingo, began late Sunday night and was briefly quelled by guards firing tear gas. But it flared anew about 2:30 a.m. when several members of one of the gangs set pillows and bedding on fire in the cellblock, known as Vietnam.

Zacaria Martínez is not sure how he survived the fire that swept through his prison cell, packed almost to the roof with inmates, killing nearly everyone inside. The only explanation he has is that it was ''at the hands of God.'' Inside the overcrowded prison here early Monday, a battle broke out in a cell known as Vietnam, the authorities said. Shots were fired and punches flew. Mattresses, machetes and other objects sailed through the air before a burst of flame came, then torrents of black, choking smoke.

There had been a protest against the Vietnam War, specifically a blockade against recruiters for the company that made napalm, and it had ended with tear gas, billy clubs, arrests and demonstrators taunting cops with cries of ''Sieg heil!'' Even at such a distance, Mr. Doyle could not call himself entirely surprised. In his senior year, he had seen the university's radicals shout down Senator Edward M. Kennedy.

After three nights of increasingly heavy rioting, the police were taking no chances on Monday, deploying dozens of busloads of officers before dusk and blocking every road leading to the factory.

Sneaking over mountain paths and wading through rice paddies, they made their way to a pharmaceuticals plant, they said, determined to pursue a showdown over the environmental threat they say it poses.

Later, the police fired tear gas and shots in the air to disperse protesters, who had begun chanting, ''We want an independent Kashmir.''

The civil unrest sweeping France spread to nearly every major city in the country by Monday, claiming its first death, and even touched two cities elsewhere in Europe as the French government sought to reassure a jittery nation that it can quickly bring the escalating situation under control. ''The government response is one of firmness,'' Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said on television late Monday, calling the violence ''unacceptable and inexcusable.'' He said the government would call up 1,500 police reserves to reinforce the 8,000 police officers already waging nightly battles in the streets. He said some towns would impose curfews to keep marauding youths off the streets, but ruled out for now sending the army into the suburbs with populations largely of West African and North African origin where the unrest has grown.

Unable to quell nearly two weeks of civil unrest across the country, the French government declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, authorizing curfews in its strife-torn suburbs, where bands of youths continued to burn cars and battle with the police. After a series of mostly ineffectual pledges by French leaders to restore order and crack down on vandals, the government invoked a 50-year-old law, dating from the colonial war in Algeria, which gives local officials the authority to call curfews, among other expanded law-enforcement powers.

With great fanfare 10 days ago, Indian and Pakistani officials agreed to allow people from the earthquake-devastated areas of Kashmir to cross the Line of Control, the heavily militarized boundary between the countries, to comfort family members on the other side. On Wednesday, at this isolated crossing point, between the Pakistani-controlled town of Chakothi and the Indian-controlled town of Uri, not a single Kashmiri crossed the border. Instead, smiling Indian and Pakistani officials exchanged several hundred sacks of aid, posed for photographs and congratulated themselves on taking a ''step in the right direction.''

Unrest continued to percolate through poor, predominantly minority neighborhoods across France on Saturday, though by the afternoon there were no signs that the arson attacks would again reach into the heart of the capital as had been feared. The police have invoked emergency measures in Paris, banning unauthorized gatherings until Sunday morning and fanning out across the city to guard landmarks and patrol subways and trains in an effort to prevent further violence. The precautions were taken after the police intercepted calls for ''violent actions'' in the city that had been posted on the Internet or passed by text messages to cellphones.

It seemed as though the whole village had turned out, hundreds of people packed into a narrow cemetery road to express their sorrow and rage at a funeral on Thursday for Moustafa Abdel Salam, a 60-year-old grandfather who took a bullet in the head and became a fatal footnote to Egypt's parliamentary elections. The three rounds of voting ended Wednesday in the fertile farming region of the Nile Delta north of Cairo. But the day after was not a day to discuss politics. For the people of this village and others throughout the area it was a day to bury the dead, to pray for the wounded and to curse the government, which they universally held responsible.

So much for holding Egypt up as a beacon of burgeoning democracy in the Middle East. Last Saturday an Egyptian court, in a move worthy of Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, sentenced Ayman Nour, the prominent liberal opposition leader, to five years at hard labor for supposedly forging signatures on petitions used to create his political party. Calling this a kangaroo court case would be an understatement. President Hosni Mubarak's security troops packed the courtroom in a show of force before Mr. Nour was brought in and locked in a foul-smelling, filthy cage to hear his fate. The charges on which the panel has convicted him are ridiculous: why would Mr. Nour forge the signatures of his own wife and father on his nomination form? Mr. Nour's second-place showing in the presidential election, collecting 7 percent of the vote, gives lie to any claim that he couldn't muster up the 50 signatures needed on the nomination papers.

Violent protests continued in Abidjan for a second day as a dispute over Parliament's mandate threatened the transitional government seeking to reunite the country, divided since civil war broke out in 2002.

On the first Monday morning of the year, four bulldozers, accompanied by nearly 300 police officers, arrived on a rocky patch of farmland on the edge of a wooded village and began leveling the earth. It was meant to be the first step in the construction of India's third-largest steel mill. Soon, from the bowels of the wooded village came an army of resistance. Armed with scythes and swords, stones and sticks -- and according to the police, bows and arrows -- the indigenous people who live on these lands in eastern India advanced toward the police line by the hundreds. Exactly what happened next is a matter of contention, except that by the day's end, the land was littered with the gore of more than a dozen dead and a fury that lingers.

Protesters angry over Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad clashed with Lebanese security forces on Sunday, setting a building housing the Danish Mission on fire and attacking a nearby church. The sectarian tone of the violence in the predominantly Christian Achrafieh section of East Beirut on Sunday raised fears of deepening divisions in Lebanon a year after a former prime minister, Rafik Hariri, was assassinated, setting off political crises in Syria and Lebanon.

Muslim anger over Danish cartoons that satirized the Prophet Muhammad continued to swell across the Middle East and elsewhere in the world on Monday, turning violent in Afghanistan, where at least five protesters died and more than a dozen police officers and protesters were wounded. As the unrest gained momentum, European diplomats worked the telephones and fanned out across the Muslim world, urging their counterparts to issue statements that might help calm the unrest that had destroyed the Danish Consulate in Lebanon and the Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Syria on Saturday.

Frustrated relatives of passengers aboard an Egyptian ferry that sank Friday in the Red Sea stormed into the office of the ship's owners here early Monday, looting it and demanding that the company and the government provide information about those lost.

Officials have sporadically released lists of survivors and photographs of the dead. But those in the crowd contended that the company was ignoring requests for more information.

A jury on Tuesday convicted Britain's most prominent radical Muslim cleric of 11 charges of soliciting murder and racial hatred for using his sermons to encourage his followers to kill non-Muslims. The cleric, Abu Hamza al-Masri, 47, is the best-known Islamic leader to face charges in a courtroom since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He was the imam of the Finsbury Park mosque in North London, which became a magnet for militants, including Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, and Zacarias Moussaoui, now on trial in the United States in connection with the attacks.

At least four people died in a day of anger and confusion, as many polling stations opened hours late. Two people died after collapsing from exhaustion in the shoving to cast ballots, while a man in the northwestern town of Gros Morne was shot to death by a police officer. Later, the same officer was killed by a vengeful crowd that hacked him to death with machetes and burned his body, a Haitian radio station reported.

So where is "The Scream"?	THE thieves struck on the morning of Aug. 22, 2004, not long after the Munch Museum had opened. Many of the 80 or so visitors there were clustered in the ground-floor gallery, where the collection's most precious paintings were on display. The late-summer Sunday doziness was broken by the sudden shouting presence of two men in balaclavas who burst in through the main entrance. They came so unexpectedly, so brazenly, that at first it was hard to know what was happening. Using a gun to force the museum guards to the ground -- neither security guards nor police officers are routinely armed in Norway -- the intruders wrenched two paintings from the main gallery wall. They treated them with so little care, banging one repeatedly against the ground to dislodge it from its frame, that witnesses spoke afterward of their shock at the brutality of the assault as much as of the theft itself.

'Twas the Night Before the Oscars One sure way to get attention for your alternative-to-the-Oscars awards: schedule them a day ahead of the big show. At the Independent Spirit Awards in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon, the big winner was ''Brokeback Mountain,'' which took best feature and best director (Ang Lee). ''Capote'' won best actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and best screenplay (Dan Futterman), and ''Transamerica'' won best actress (Felicity Huffman, right) and first screenplay (Duncan Tucker). The prizes are given by Film Independent, a nonprofit group that nurtures indie filmmakers. At the less reverent Razzies, the annual salute to the worst of Hollywood, Tom Cruise and his fiancée, Katie Holmes -- combined, they are the entity known in gossip columns simply as TomKat -- were named the ''most tiresome tabloid targets,'' a new prize meant to recognize the most overexposed celebrities. But the biggest winner at the awards, bestowed by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation, was ''Dirty Love,'' written by and starring the former Playboy Playmate Jenny McCarthy. It won four prizes, including worst picture, worst actress and screenplay (both for Ms. McCarthy), and worst director (John Mallory Asher). Grandma-in-Drag Tops Box Office In a slow weekend at the box office, Tyler Perry's comedy ''Madea's Family Reunion'' (Lions Gate) held off new films starring Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich to remain No. 1 for a second week. ''Madea,'' in which Mr. Perry, left, dresses up in dowdy drag as a Southern grandma working to organize a family gathering, took in an estimated $13 million. That was a drop of some 57 percent from its ticket sales last week, but still enough to top ''16 Blocks'' (Warner Brothers), a thriller starring Mr. Willis and Mos Def, which landed at No. 2 with $11.6 million. Two other new films had slow openings: ''Ultraviolet'' (Sony/Screen Gems), a sci-fi action picture starring Ms. Jovovich, took in $9 million, reaching No. 4, and ''Aquamarine'' (Fox), about a mermaid who appears at a seaside swimming pool, was No. 5 with $7.5 million. ''Eight Below'' (Buena Vista), about the survival of a pack of abandoned ice-sled dogs in the Antarctic, dropped one spot to No. 3 with $10.2 million in its third week of release, bring its total ticket sales to $58.7 million. Overall, the box office was down 16.5 percent from the weekend before, and 23.2 percent from the same weekend last year. Welcome Back, Edna Divine. Harvey Fierstein. Now John Travolta? The onetime ''Saturday Night Fever'' heartthrob, below, now 52, will play the role of Edna Turnblad in the film version of ''Hairspray,'' the hit Broadway musical based on John Waters's 1988 movie. Divine played the character, the mother of an aspiring teenage dancer, in the original film, and Mr. Fierstein won a Tony Award for the role in the Broadway version. Queen Latifah, 35, the rapper, singer and actress, is to play Motormouth Maybelle in the film, which is being made by New Line. Production is to begin this fall for a potential summer 2007 release, Reuters reported. Book Critics' Awards E. L. Doctorow's fictionalized tale of Sherman's march, an autobiography by Francine du Plessix Gray and a history of Chernobyl are among the winners of this year's National Book Critics Circle Awards. For fiction, Mr. Doctorow's ''March'' (Random House) beat books by William T. Vollmann, Mary Gaitskill, Andrea Levy and Kazuo Ishiguro. Svetlana Alexievich took the nonfiction prize for ''Voices From Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster'' (Dalkey Archive Press). In autobiography, a new category, Ms. Gray's ''Them: A Memoir of Parents'' (Penguin Press) won over books by Joan Didion, Judith Moore, Orhan Pamuk and Vikram Seth. In biography, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin won for ''American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer'' (Knopf). William Logan took the criticism award for ''The Undiscovered Country: Poetry in the Age of Tin'' (Columbia University Press), and Jack Gilbert's ''Refusing Heaven'' (Knopf) won for poetry. Riot at Punk Concert Rioting broke out at a concert east of Los Angeles on Saturday night, injuring several people and destroying two police cars, The Associated Press reported. Two dozen mostly British punk bands, including GBH and the Adicts, were playing at ''British Invasion 2K6'' at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino. The rioting began when the police responded to a report of a stabbing. The crowd of 1,500 became agitated and several fights broke out, the police said. The officers extracted the stabbing victim and another person who had been beaten, but the violent crowd forced the police to withdraw. After calling for backup, officers lined up in phalanx formation to clear the area, firing pepper balls and tear gas to move the crowd. As the audience dispersed, rioters destroyed two police cars, set a trash bin on fire and smashed storefront windows, the police said.

French riot police officers fired tear gas into the historic Sorbonne building at the University of Paris early Saturday to disperse students who had occupied part of the 19th-century stone edifice since Wednesday. The students were part of nationwide protests against new employment regulations that will allow employers to hire and fire young workers more easily. Hundreds of thousands of people have joined demonstrations to protest new rules for a ''first employment contract,'' which gives companies the right to hire people under the age of 26 for a two-year trial period, during which they can be fired without cause.

For the second time in four months, French streets are filled with riot police, tear gas and rampaging youths. But the similarity is deceptive. Back in November, it was the sons of North African immigrants in their dreary suburbs exploding in frustration at the lack of jobs, prospects or programs. It was hard not to feel sympathy with their cause, along with outrage at their response. This time, privileged university students have been protesting what they see as an assault on the job security that they consider their birthright. But the labor reform to which they are so opposed is much needed and was proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin as a partial answer to those who rioted in the suburbs.

With more huge marches planned for next week as part of a continuing protest over a new jobs law, the casseurs are the volatile chemical that could ignite an even bigger crisis for the government than the impasse over the law itself.

Three people died, hundreds of others were injured and more than 200 were arrested in two days of clashes between the police and Kurdish protestors in Diyarbakir, in the mainly Kurdish southeast, officials said. The fighting began after funerals for four Kurdish rebels killed by Turkish troops last week. Television news reports showed groups of mostly young people hurling stones and Molotov cocktails at armored police vehicles, as the police used tear gas to disperse the crowds. At least 130 police officers were injured, and the local headquarters of the country's governing Justice and Development Party was ransacked, the Anatolian News Agency reported. SEBNEM ARSU (NYT)

Seeking to defuse a growing revolt that has paralyzed his government, President Jacques Chirac offered a compromise on Friday, saying in a nationwide address that he would soften a divisive new labor law and calling on student and trade union leaders to begin constructive talks. His offer was swiftly rejected, and after the speech several thousand young people spilled into the streets in a spontaneous march that wound its way through central Paris. The protesters, who first tried to approach Élysée Palace, eventually made their way to the Sorbonne, in the Latin Quarter, where they were dispersed by police officers firing tear gas.

Waves of demonstrations, strikes and violence hit France again on Tuesday as Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, weakened but defiant, refused to bend to the demand that the government scrap a disputed youth labor law. It was the fifth nationwide protest since February against a modest initiative that was aimed at encouraging the hiring of young people but that has provoked an improvised, open-ended campaign against the French government itself.

Park Chanwook does not look like a violent man. When he isn't wearing glasses, his soft, round face resembles that of a gentle Tang dynasty Buddha. He speaks quietly and smiles a lot, more like a hip college professor than the director of an ultraviolent revenge trilogy. Pinned on the walls of his office in Seoul, among the movie posters and postcards, are photographs of his wife and 12-year-old daughter. His wife, whom he met at a university film club in the 1980's, reads all his scripts and is his most trusted adviser. Their daughter has seen most of his films. A nice, quiet, reflective family man, then, this 42-year-old director who also happens to be a master of imagery at times so brutal that it is almost unbearable to watch.

The royal government struggled to dam a tide of pro-democracy protest on Thursday.

The New York Times	article	http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/technology/27scene.html	Business/Financial Desk	Technology; Business	French politicians have abandoned one of the guiding principles of antitrust economics: penalize companies that harm consumers, not the ones that are building better products.	THE French take pride in their revolutions, which are usually hard to miss -- mass uprisings, heads rolling and such. So, with the scent of tear gas in the air this past month from the giant protests against a youth labor law, it was easy to overlook the French National Assembly's approval of a bill that would require Apple Computer to crack open the software codes of its iTunes music store and let the files work on players other than the iPod. While seemingly minor, the move is actually rather startling and has left many experts wondering (as ever): What has possessed the French? More is at stake than just whether French teenagers can get Chimène Badi tracks at iTunes for 0.99 euro. The move may signify a willingness to question the patents, copyrights and trade secrets of other successful products as well, like electronics, pharmaceuticals, even fast food. Might we soon see a French legislator demanding to know if it is fair that customers of the French fast-food chain Quick cannot get its signature burger, Le Giant, with McDonald's special sauce?

Paris is proud of its spirit of exhibitionism, so the front-page newspaper headline last weekend that the city's man-made beach was enforcing a ban on thongs and bare breasts came as a bit of a shock. Not only that, the article in the tabloid Le Parisien reported, but the police might go so far as to hand out a $48 fine for anyone who refused to cover up.

With the country locked in a battle over the results of last month's elections, President Vicente Fox for the first time defended the vote that narrowly favored his party's candidate as clean and fair, rejecting allegations of widespread irregularities. ''The process has been transparent in the eyes of the world,'' the president said Sunday evening in an interview at his residence inside Los Pinos, the presidential compound. ''It was watched by the media. There were observers. The entire world was watching the electoral process. There is nothing hidden.''

For three months, civil unrest has gripped this lovely colonial city like a hound with a rabbit, leaving two people dead, crippling the tourist industry and shuttering schools. The original cause of the strife -- a teachers' strike for better pay -- has become lost in the escalating violence and the revolutionary demands of the protesters, who now demand that Gov. Ulises Ruiz step down.

No place in this country symbolizes the resilience of Venezuela's moneyed elite more than the Caracas Country Club, a bastion of tropical luxury from the 1920's, conceived in part for foreign oilmen and designed by American landscape architects who invoked the feeling of a vast coffee plantation. So imagine the reactions in Caracas, a city choked by shantytowns and traffic congestion, when the mayor ordered the ''forced acquisition'' this week of the club's 18-hole golf course, and another exclusive course near the United States Embassy, to make way for homes for as many as 11,500 poor families.

The police and protesters clashed in Budapest after thousands of Hungarians marched to demand that Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, left, resign after admitting that he had told colleagues that his government had ''lied in the morning and in the evening'' about the economy to win April's election. It was the first such street violence since the fall of Communism in the late 1980's. Protesters hurled bottles and stones at the police, who fired tear gas to stop them from forcing their way into the state television offices. The protest was set off by a leaked audio recording of a closed-door meeting by Mr. Gyurcsany appealing to his party after the election to change its ways. The Socialist Party rallied behind its prime minister, who took office in 2004.

A senior cleric who opposes religious rule of Iran and a number of his followers were arrested Sunday after clashes with the riot police over the weekend, news agencies reported. About 1,000 supporters of the cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, gathered outside his home and on the streets leading to it on Saturday, the semiofficial ILNA news agency reported. They were there apparently to protect him from arrest and to protest the arrests over the past month of other supporters who had tried to protect him after a court had summoned him.

INTERNATIONAL A3-9 North Korea Announces Test of Nuclear Weapon North Korea said that it had set off its first nuclear test -- just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences. American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. A1 The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.'' A6 Tsunami Project Stalled Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started. A8 Hints at Need for Iraq Change James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria. A1 American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months. A8 Japan and China Mend Fences China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined. A3 Iran Opposition Cleric Seized Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them. A3 Transponder Not Recalled The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said. A9 NATIONAL A10-15 Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. A1 Virginia Republicans Resolute In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents. A1 For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year. A12 Races Hinge on Local Economy Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one. A10 Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case. A10 Fight Over National Park Hunt Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December. A15 Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said. A10 Senator's Finances Questioned For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Despite Criticism at Home, Giuliani Retains Support Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is scheduled to make his first public appearance in two years in New Hampshire. Yet as Mr. Giuliani traverses the country, polls show he has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential primaries -- largely because of how he guided a wounded city in the weeks after 9/11. B1 Cluster of Sex Offenders A house where four sex offenders lived together as roommates has caused an uproar in Suffolk County, where one Suffolk County lawmaker has called for legislation to prevent groups of registered sex offenders from living together. B1 A Mall of Knockoffs In the last two years, the city has seized close to $50 million in counterfeit goods from the city's top haven for knockoff and phony goods, and shut down 15 buildings that it claimed were once occupied almost entirely by counterfeiters, but thousands of people still pack the area on weekends. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Steinbrenner Silent on Torre George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is fuming over the team's first-round elimination by the Detroit Tigers. He issued a blistering statement through his publicist but took no action on Joe Torre, his manager for the last 11 seasons. D1 Ugly Finish at Talladega Brian Vickers won the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, after pushing his teammate Jimmie Johnson's car into Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the backstretch of the last lap. D9 ARTS E1-10 Unlikely Success at Book Fair A book by the American author Jonathan Littell, ''Les Bienveillantes,'' has taken the Frankfurt fair, the world's largest booksellers' convention, by storm. Written in French, the novel features an unrepentant Nazi SS officer as the hero and could command $1 million, publishers say. E1 OBITUARIES B9 David G. Salten An innovative and influential educator who devised a desegregation plan for the New Rochelle, N.Y., school system and, as an expert witness in 1958, urged the immediate opening of the newly integrated schools in Little Rock, Ark., he was 93. B9 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 Restructuring Airbus Discussions over who would ultimately make decisions regarding the restructuring at Airbus continued over the weekend, and executives close to the talks said that the chief executive, M.

Four Palestinians, including three Hamas militants, were killed Friday in a second day of deadly clashes with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip. In a separate confrontation, Palestinian gunmen from the two main factions, Hamas and Fatah, battled each other overnight and during the day on Friday, leaving a teenager dead and nearly 50 people wounded in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, the Palestinians said.

With Israel imposing tight restrictions on Palestinian movements, the holy month of Ramadan marks a rare occasion when large numbers of Palestinians from the West Bank can enter Jerusalem to worship at the Aksa Mosque compound, one of the most sacred sites in Islam. On Friday, the last one before Ramadan ends, an estimated 180,000 Muslims from the West Bank and Israel filled the narrow stone streets of Jerusalem's Old City and prayed at the compound. But it was no consolation for the thousands of West Bank men who were turned back at the city's edge, some in scuffles with Israeli security forces.

When the call went out about a car burglary in the raw suburb of Épinay-sur-Seine north of here last weekend, three officers in a patrol car rushed over and found themselves surrounded by 30 youths in hoods throwing rocks and swinging bats and metal bars. Neither tear gas nor stun guns stopped the assault. Only when reinforcements arrived did the siege end. One officer was left with broken teeth and in need of 30 stitches to his face.

Violent clashes in Budapest on Monday as the police tried to contain a month-old antigovernment protest movement marred the 50th anniversary of Hungary's uprising against Soviet domination. The police used rubber bullets, tear gas and a water cannon to disperse thousands of protesters who had gathered for a rally after a group of them took control of a Soviet-era T-34 tank that was on display for the commemorations and drove it toward the police. About two dozen people were injured, none seriously.

Last week, the police and protesters in Budapest celebrated the 50th anniversary of Hungary's uprising against the Soviet Union the old-fashioned way: with tear gas, a purloined tank and calls for the ouster of the prime minister. The Film Society of Lincoln Center has opted for a quieter remembrance of those tragic events with a three-week, three-part program dedicated to old, new and relatively unknown Hungarian cinema. The awkwardly titled RESISTANCE AND REBIRTH: HUNGARIAN CINEMA, 50 YEARS AFTER '56 actually encompasses separate but related points of interest: ''Remembering '56,'' which highlights work about the uprising and its aftermath, including Istvan Szabo's autobiographically informed 1966 film ''Father''; the self-explanatory ''Tribute to Miklos Jancso: The Currents of History''; and ''New Cinema From Hungary.'' In recent years, Hungary has pushed hard to become a European film hub, notably with financial incentives that have helped local and foreign production alike. The fruits of its newly revived cinema scene have been trickling into international film festivals and, on occasion, into American art houses. Lajos Koltai's extremely moving adaptation of the Nobel Prize-winner Imre Kertesz's personal novel about the Holocaust, ''Fateless,'' opened here in January to enthusiastic notices and scant public interest and is now, happily, available on DVD. Among the new works in the festival are the critical favorite ''Kontroll,'' which enjoyed a marginally better run last year, and the singularly enthralling opera ''Johanna,'' about an accident victim turned angel of mercy who prowls an atmospherically dilapidated hospital in which the sounds of music include the refrain ''Let's run to urology!''

Federal forces moved to take back this picturesque tourist town one cobblestone street at a time on Sunday, bashing through barricades and pushing back activists who had seized the downtown five months ago in an increasingly ugly dispute with the state governor. Police officers wearing riot gear and carrying shields were backed by water cannons, police helicopters and heavily armed soldiers as they marched from all directions toward Oaxaca's main square, the Zócalo, which used to draw tourists but in recent months has been a giant encampment for an array of groups intent on toppling Ulises Ruiz, the governor of Oaxaca State.

An Army Reservist despondent about being sent to Iraq was killed by the police during a 14-hour standoff that began Monday night. The man, James E. Dean, 28, had barricaded himself inside his father's house with several weapons, family members told the police.

Two people were killed and more than 70 wounded as supporters of President Evo Morales and seekers of regional autonomy battled one another with guns, sticks and rocks on the streets of Cochabamba, in central Bolivia. Fighting broke out when supporters of Manfredo Reyes Villa, governor of the state with the same name as the city, entered downtown Cochabamba, occupied since Monday by thousands of supporters of the leftist president demanding that the governor step down over his plans to call a referendum on regional autonomy. A television station said two people, one of them a coca-leaf farmer, had been killed, but it was not immediately clear how. Television showed hundreds of men running through the streets, some carrying sticks, as onlookers applauded and the police fired tear gas. The government sent in troops.

Security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators in the capital, Conakry, as street protests spread to seven other towns and cities on the eighth day of a general strike intended to force the country's ailing president, Lansana Conté, to step down. Mr. Conté, left, a 72-year-old diabetic chain-smoker with no obvious successor, grabbed power in a 1984 coup and has refused to relinquish control despite a heart ailment that has required him to travel to Switzerland for care several times in the past year. He is also said to be senile. The strike began after he halted the trial of two men accused of stealing millions of dollars from the state.

Even as Bassam Aramin mourns his 10-year-old daughter, killed last week during a clash between stone-throwing Palestinian youths and the Israeli police, he says he wants to talk to Israelis about making peace. It has been a long journey for Mr. Aramin, 38, a former Palestinian fighter. He spent seven years in Israeli jails, from 1986 to 1993, for weapons possession and for belonging to the Fatah movement, which was banned at the time.

Amid a grove of poplar trees in a village just north of here, a grave was unearthed Thursday afternoon. Out came the body of a man, shot dead nearly two months ago, whom the Indian police described at the time as an anti-Indian militant from Pakistan. An elderly man, who had been searching for his missing son for nearly two months, was summoned for the exhumation. He stared at the horror dug out of the ground and told the police what he had refused to believe all this time. ''He is my son,'' he said. Then he sat on the bare ground and shook.

For hundreds of years, the Indians of Bolivia's high plains have trekked to this town in early February. They dance, drink chicha, the fermented beverage made here from rye, and then fight one another until blood stains the dirt alleyways. The ritual, called Tinku, a word that means ''encounter'' in both Aymara and Quechua, was once widespread throughout the Andean world, predating the arrival of the conquistadors. Anthropologists say it now tenuously exists just in this isolated pocket of Bolivia, seven hours southeast of La Paz by bus on a washboard dirt road.

President Bush has portrayed his trip to Latin America this week as a ''We Care'' tour aimed at dispelling perceptions that he has neglected his southern neighbors. But fresh graffiti on streets here in São Paulo, where he landed Thursday night for his first stop, calls him a murderer. The smattering of protests and the placement of military vehicles around the city, South America's largest, also present an alternate interpretation of his visit: as a clash between the open capitalism that Mr. Bush espouses and the socialist approach pushed by leftist leaders who have grown in power and popularity.

An additional 4,000 protesters gathered in surrounding streets. The police hurled rocks back at the crowd, and some beat residents of a tent camp set up by the protesters last week. As the crowd was dispersed, street lighting was switched off in the center of this city of nearly a million people and gangs of young men carrying sticks roamed the streets. There were several reports of looting. The interior minister, Bolotbek Nogoibayev, said that the police had detained 100 demonstrators and that any new protests or crowds would be dispersed.

Chamberlain stood in a cold drizzle some 200 yards from his family's weekend house in the shadow of the Catskill Mountains as members of an elite state police unit were preparing to storm it. They were looking Wednesday afternoon for Travis D. Trim, a fugitive and petty criminal who they believed had shot three state troopers over the previous 24 hours, killing one, and who they suspected was holed up inside. But moments before the siege was to begin, a final round of tear gas was hurled into the cream-colored farmhouse, which suddenly caught fire.

Brinkerhoff was killed by a suspect he and other officers had cornered.	The bullet that killed a New York state trooper during a shootout Wednesday morning in a farmhouse in the Catskill Mountains came from the gun of a fellow officer, not the suspect they had cornered, the state police said yesterday. The police said that the suspect, who was hiding in the house after shooting another trooper the day before, fired one bullet at the slain trooper, David C. Brinkerhoff, but that it hit his body armor. That bullet knocked Trooper Brinkerhoff onto one knee. He was then struck once in the back of the head, fatally, during the fusillade of bullets that followed from three other troopers.

Estonia's government removed a Soviet-era war memorial early on Friday morning after a night of protest and violence that killed one person, injured dozens and left a swath of shattered windows and overturned cars in the center of the capital, Tallinn, officials there said. The removal of the monument, which includes a six-and-a-half-foot sculpture known as the Bronze Soldier, prompted a renewed diplomatic fury in neighboring Russia, where officials have repeatedly declared that tampering with the monument amounted to blasphemy and even the glorification of Nazism.

Turnout was 84 percent of France’s registered voters.	Nicolas Sarkozy, the passionate, pugnacious son of a Hungarian immigrant, was elected president of France on Sunday, promising a break with the past, a new style of leadership, and a renewal of relations with the United States and the rest of Europe. Mr. Sarkozy's triumph over Ségolène Royal, the Socialist candidate, was a huge blow to her party and dashed her dream of becoming the country's first female president. But Ms. Royal tried to rally her supporters, telling them French politics had forever changed with her candidacy.

Violent protests against the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France ended early Monday after hundreds of people were arrested, hundreds of cars gutted, and hundreds of windows smashed in several cities across France. Many people fear that the violence is just a taste of what is to come if Mr. Sarkozy makes good on his campaign promises to push through divisive legislation during his first 100 days in office.

President Néstor Kirchner threatened to crack down on private rail operators for failing to make upgrades after commuters frustrated by constant delays in train service to Buenos Aires's poor suburbs set fire to parts of the city's Constitución station on Tuesday, looted nearby shops and clashed with the police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The passengers' anger came to a head in the evening rush hour when a train broke down on a track just outside the station, blocking other trains from leaving the station, which serves some 300,000 commuters daily. Buenos Aires area commuter rail lines were privatized in the 1990s, and passengers have complained for years about the failure of the new operators to provide timely service on often crowded routes.

A bomb ripped through a historic mosque in this southern Indian city on Friday, killing 11 people. Two more died in clashes that followed between Muslim worshipers and security forces, the police said. Minutes after the blast at the Mecca Masjid, which was built in the 17th century, worshipers who were angered by what they said had been a lack of police protection began chanting ''God is great!'' and hurling stones at the police.

Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two, spicy and pungent, wafting through ''Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art. But tear gas, with its weird-sweet burn, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul.

James Dean was shot at his childhood home by a sniper representing his government.	The sniper fired. It was a clean shot, if there is such a thing. And down for good fell another American soldier. His name was Sergeant James Dean, but everyone called him Jamie. He was the farm boy who fished, hunted and tossed a horseshoe like nobody else. He was the guy at the end of Toots Bar, nursing a Bud and talking Nascar. He was the driver of that blue Silverado at the red light, his hands on the wheel, his mind on combat horrors that made him moody, angry, withdrawn.

With little more than an hour to go late Sunday until this country's oldest television network was to be taken off the air after 53 years of broadcasting, the police dispersed thousands of protesters by firing tear gas into demonstrations against the measure. The police said that shots were fired in their direction and that protesters hurling rocks had injured 11 officers. Local television showed images of policemen with guns drawn patrolling a highway that had been closed near one demonstration. Protesters in other areas of the city burned tires, apparently eliciting the police reaction.

The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40).Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side. (Isherwood) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Bellafante) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi-science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors onstage to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'I LOVE YOU , YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE!' This revue has proved as indestructible as the truisms about men and women on which it is based: it has run for 11 years Off Broadway and spread around the world. Now one of its avatars is coming for a visit: the Mandarin production with Lin Yilun, a major Chinese star, has arrived in New York for a limited run, playing concurrently with the English version. This is supposedly the first time a foreign production of an American musical has played in the United States (and the first Chinese-language production of a major American musical). It will be interesting to see how the piece's hoary stereotypes change in translation; Joel Bishoff, the original director, modified the work to reflect Chinese culture for its Shanghai run (2:00). The Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; Mandarin version closes on Sunday. (Anne Midgette) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates) 'SILVERLAND' Global warming and the melting of the ice caps have destroyed London in this environmentally (if not dramatically) aware debut. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'EVEN MONEY' (R, 108 minutes) This grim, lurid scare movie about gambling addiction consists of several interlocking horror stories that converge in a format similar to that of ''Crash.'' More than its forerunner, this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics. (Holden) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) '9 STAR HOTEL' (No rating, 78 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) Ido Haar's fascinating documentary follows a group of illegal Palestinian construction workers as they scrabble to survive in and around the Israeli city of Modiin. With an open mind and a handheld camera, this Israeli filmmaker strives to make the political personal; but by excluding Israeli voices, Mr. Haar has produced a work filled with immediacy but free of analysis. (Catsoulis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SEVERANCE' (R, 90 minutes) A weapons company retreat in a Hungarian forest turns into a bloody game of whack-a-mole in this sophomore horror film from the British director Christopher Smith. The political argument may be broad -- there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard -- but the visual technique is sharp, creating a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its survey of the work of the tabloid-trained film director Samuel Fuller. The highlights in this session are 35-millimeter prints of Fuller's two films for Allied Artists, from the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive: the astounding ''Shock Corridor,'' in which a madhouse becomes a metaphor for American society about 1963, and ''The Naked Kiss'' (1964), the only film I can think of offhand that begins with a bald prostitute (Constance Towers) beating her pimp to death with a telephone handset. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr) 'MALA NOCHE' (Tonight through Thursday) Gus Van Sant's first feature, shot in Portland in 1985, announces many of the themes of his later work but operates with a ragged spontaneity that has largely vanished from his highly formalist recent features. Tim Streeter stars as Walt, a convenience-store clerk who conceives a one-sided love for a Mexican teenager (Doug Cooeyate). The film, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter, has now been digitally restored and features a new soundtrack remastered by Mr. Van Sant. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Tonight through Thursday) For a second year, the organizers of the Sundance Film Festival are taking a selection of films, theater and music created or presented under their aegis to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The film component includes seven features from this year's Sundance festival that have not yet found theatrical distribution (including ''Padre Nuestro,'' the winner of this year's Grand Jury Prize for dramatic film), so this may be the one chance New Yorkers will have to see them on a screen. This weekend's screenings include: ''Rocket Science,'' the fiction debut of Jeffrey Blitz, who directed the documentary ''Spellbound''; ''War/Dance,'' a documentary by Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine about three children growing up in the combat zone of northern Uganda; ''Snow Angels,'' a drama by David Gordon Green (''George Washington'') starring Sam Rockwell as an alcoholic Southerner in the painful process of separating from his wife (Kate Beckinsale); ''Delirious,'' Tom DiCillo's comic portrait of a desperate paparazzi (Steve Buscemi); and ''Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,'' a documentary about the drummer of The Clash, directed by the music video pioneer Julien Temple. Sunday is devoted to four programs that together contain 27 short films. The series continues through June 10. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. KEREN ANN (Monday) With exquisitely delicate, sensuous songs that seem never to touch the ground, Keren Ann Zeidel -- born in Tel Aviv and raised in Paris -- is the model of the modern cosmopolitan chanteuse, part jazzy, part indie-cabaret and part glam-folk. With Jason Hart. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) ALAN BERGMAN (Tuesday) With a new album, ''Lyrically, Alan Bergman'' (Verve), this three-time Oscar-winning songwriter (''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' ''The Way We Were'') makes a rare appearance at Joe's Pub. At 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) BRAZZAVILLE (Tonight) While playing saxophone for Beck in the '90s, David Brown learned guitar and started Brazzaville, writing languid, bittersweet songs in a multicultural update of the vagabond cabaret of Tom Waits and Tindersticks. Four years ago he relocated to Barcelona and formed a new version of the band, still singing about crumbling cafes and the way his former lovers held their cigarettes. The new Brazzaville makes its American debut tonight at 9:30 at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) * BRIGHT EYES (Tonight) In the indie-rock equivalent of Bruce Springsteen's filling up Giants Stadium for weeks on end, Bright Eyes -- consisting of the excessively confessional man-child Conor Oberst (dressed in Prada these days) and whomever he's playing with -- has sold out seven shows at Town Hall, ending tonight. His guest is Gillian Welch, who plays a mellow bluegrass-folk hybrid with grace. At 7:30, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario) CALIFONE (Thursday) A mainstay of the Chicago experimental-rock scene, Califone plays wistful songs with a constant thin hum. With the Bitter Tears and Curtis Harvey. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15. (Sisario) * JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. She is back at the Café Carlyle for a series of encore performances. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $150 cover at tables, $100 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) CSS (Tonight) Over bare, exuberant and deliberately amateurish art-funk, this mostly female Brazilian group celebrates the sacrament of casual sex through come-ons shouted and mumbled in robotic, broken English. (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake.'') With Yo Majesty. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) * DATAROCK (Tomorrow) It might seem impossible at this point to find something new on the well-traveled path of electro dance-rock. But somehow this Norwegian duo does it, with spiky disco, a full supply of funk guitar riffs and a rock 'n' roll attitude that mixes snarls with catchy, silly ''Fa-fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa'' choruses. With Low Bee and Passions. At 10 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario) DEAN AND BRITTA (Tomorrow) In Luna, Dean Wareham expertly channeled the cool, slow-shifting guitar clouds of the mid-period Velvet Underground. Since dissolving Luna two years ago, he has been playing with its former bassist, Britta Phillips, and on their new album, ''Back Numbers'' (Zoe/Rounder), they emulate, with unfortunate stiffness, another touchstone of 1960s cool: the bare, dissolute country of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. With My Robot Friend. At 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $18. (Sisario) * DINOSAUR JR., AWESOME COLOR (Wednesday and Thursday) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, prefiguring Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited two years ago and just released ''Beyond'' (Fat Possum), their first album together in 18 years, sounding as brawny and vigorous as ever. Awesome Color's gruff, retro garage-blues is self-consciously noisy as only New York rock can be, but it is also indebted -- and seems partly a homage -- to the vintage Detroit proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) JOHN DOE (Wednesday and Thursday) In the seminal Los Angeles punk band X and on his own, John Doe has linked a rugged sentimentality to twangy, rockabilly-tinged songs, and is particularly good at singing with women. His latest, ''A Year in the Wilderness'' (Yep Roc), features Aimee Mann, Jill Sobule and Kathleen Edwards aside longtime collaborators like the guitarist Dave Alvin. Wednesday at 9 p.m., BAMCafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. Thursday at 8 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $10. (Sisario) * ROKY ERICKSON AND ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tomorrow) One of the godfathers of psychedelic rock, who howled like a werewolf over the flutter of an electric jug in his 1960s band the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson is also one of the most notorious casualties of that era. Now, at 59 and in his best health in years, he is back on the road with a tough, no-nonsense band, and at his belated New York debut seven weeks ago tore through classics like ''You're Gonna Miss Me'' with ease and lots of low-end guitar fuzz. Alejandro Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, rivertorivernyc.com. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario) FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960s and '70s -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MARIANNE FAITHFULL (Wednesday) Marianne Faithfull applies her husky ruin of a voice to songs about harrowing moments and bitter realizations. In songs she wrote herself or chose with exacting standards, she reveals every scar with bleak fascination and no regrets. At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 307-7171; $75. (Jon Pareles) FALL OUT BOY, +44, THE ACADEMY IS , PAUL WALL, COBRA STARSHIP (Tuesday and Wednesday) They could have called it Monsters of Emo, but certain considerations led to a name that is less rock 'n' roll but perhaps just as indicative of mainstream success: the Honda Civic Tour. Fall Out Boy remains the model second-wave (or is this the third?) emo band: snarky and jumpy, interested in relationships over solitude, and bursting with melodic pop-punk riffs. Also on the bill are +44, with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182; the Houston rapper Paul Wall; and Cobra Starship, adrift in a sea of dance-punk irony.

Ticket holders on Tuesday and Thursday can also enjoy worthy ''prelude concerts'': on Tuesday the bass-baritone Christian Van Horn and the pianist Molly Morkoski offer Beethoven, Schubert and Mendelssohn, and on Thursday, Jeremy Denk plays Ives's Piano Sonata No. 2. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. (prelude concerts at 6:45), (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Schweitzer) BRUCE LEVINGSTON (Tuesday) As part of its ''Surreal Delicacy of René Clair'' series, the French Institute/Alliance Française is offering a recital devoted to the music of Erik Satie, including his score for Clair's film ''Entr'acte,'' which will be performed with a screening of it. The pianist Bruce Levingston will also perform Satie's ''Sports et Divertissements,'' with Nick McDonnell narrating. At 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $30; $25 for students and members. (Kozinn) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Monday) For the seventh year, Mannes will begin its weeklong immersion in Beethoven's solo, duo, trio and quartet music. In addition to private lessons and master classes, there's a faculty concert on Monday. At 8 p.m., Mannes College the New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes/summer; $20. (Bernard Holland) DILIANA MOMTCHILOVA AND VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Ms. Momtchilova, a Bulgarian cellist who won first prize at the Washington International Competition, joins forces with the superb Russian pianist Vassily Primakov for a recital of Bach, Fauré, Debussy, Schubert and Popper at Arium, a comfortable hybrid of a restaurant and a concert hall. Arium's concerts are relatively genteel experiences: before and after the performance, listeners are served wine or Champagne, hors d'oeuvres and dessert. At 5 p.m., Arium, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Kozinn) NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Thursday) Music, birds, saints and true love: Hallmark sentiment to some, poetry in the hands of Yeats and Auden, and the themes of this program by the noted amateur chorus led by Clara Longstreth and accompanied here by everything from marimba to harpsichord. The evening includes four New York premieres by David Brunner, Paul Crabtree, Howard Skempton and Richard Wilson. At 8 p.m., Church of the Holy Trinity, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 842-1511, nasingers.org; $20. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Brahms series, conducted by Lorin Maazel, ambles on in this morning's performance of the Third and Fourth Symphonies and then heats up for the next week. A new Brahms program tomorrow evening, repeated on Tuesday, offers the ''Haydn'' Variations and the ''German'' Requiem, with the soprano Celena Shafer and the baritone Matthias Goerne. A whole new program on Thursday brings the conductor Riccardo Muti, and Lang Lang as soloist, in the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $29 to $104. (Holland) * LUCY SHELTON (Tuesday) The Movado Hour is a series of one-hour chamber music concerts presented by the enterprising Baryshnikov Arts Center in a wonderfully informal salon setting. Tuesday's enticing program offers the soprano (and contemporary-music champion) Lucy Shelton; the pianist Pedja Muzijevic, who is also the center's director of music programs; and the dynamic Brentano String Quartet in a program of works by George Crumb (''Apparitions'') and Brahms (the Piano Quintet in F minor). At 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 934-4966, baryshinikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) It's here at last: the controversial new production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' created by Gelsey Kirkland, Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov. If even half the rumors pan out, this re-envisioning of a classic should be revelatory, and a trip. The leads -- the Princess Aurora, her prince, the Lilac Fairy and the evil Carabosse -- will be danced by Veronika Part, Marcelo Gomes, Gillian Murphy and Martine van Hamel (tonight); Paloma Herrera, Ángel Corella, Michele Wiles and Carmen Corella (tomorrow's matinee and Thursday); Julie Kent, Ethan Stiefel, Stella Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (tomorrow night and Tuesday); Ms. Part, Mr. Gomes, Ms. Murphy and Ms. Kirkland (Monday); Irina Dvorovenko, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Ms. Wiles and Ms. Kirkland (Wednesday matinee), and Diana Vishneva, David Hallberg, Ms. Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (Wednesday night). Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110. (Jennifer Dunning) RENEE ARCHIBALD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Archibald's ''Oh Dear Natascha'' explores darkness and confinement in an environment filled with small piles of samples and clippings quietly waiting, as Ms. Archibald puts it, ''for an imaginary domestic life in various imaginary cities.'' Well, why not? At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) LORI BELILOVE (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Belilove, who specializes in the dances of Isadora Duncan, will present her own choreography in a program titled ''The EveryWoman Series: The Red Thread.'' The dances are set to music by Chopin, performed live. (Through June 8.) At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 691-5040, isadoraduncan.org; $28; $60 for gala on Thursday. (Dunning) * BOOGIE DOWN DANCE SERIES AT BAAD! (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) In its last week the festival will present dance by the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater troupe (tonight and tomorrow night); ''Dancing on Broken Glass,'' a panel discussion on the growth and state of professional dance in the Bronx (Tuesday); and an evening of Bronx-based dance by artists chosen by Christal Brown and Movement Research (Wednesday). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, the Bronx, (718) 842-5223, bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15 tonight and tomorrow; free on Tuesday; $12 and $15 on Wednesday. (Dunning) DANCE AT DIXON PLACE (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) First comes ''Brink,'' a showcase tonight and tomorrow night that features dance by Regina Rocke and Lise Serrell and Becky Serrell, all chosen by Michael Helland. On Thursday night ''Underexposed'' will feature work by Elise Knudson, Irem Calikusu, Dorian Nuskind-Oder, Beth Bradford and Casey Blake, all chosen by Monica Bill Barnes and Shannon Hummel. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $12; $10 for students and 65+; Theater Development Fund discount vouchers accepted on Thursdays. (Dunning) DANCE AT DNA (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) In Ben Munisteri's new ''Terra Nova,'' dancers leave a design of moving colors and patterns in their wake, courtesy of motion-capture technology. (Through Sunday.) The Stefanie Nelson Dance Group follows on Thursday in Ms. Nelson's new mixed-media ''Out of Wonderland,'' a collaboration with the video artist Nell Breyer and the composer Andrea Ferrara. (Through June 9.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25 tonight through Sunday; $17 on Thursday. (Dunning) DANIEL GWIRTZMAN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Apparently Mr. Gwirtzman was once known as ''Disco Danny,'' which suggests that his new evening-length ''Encore,'' set to jazz and popular music, may indeed offer the ''accessibility and entertainment value'' that its publicity promises. Perhaps there will even be a disco ball. (Through June 9.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; $15 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas) KOOSIL-JA'S MECH[A] OUTPUT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Koosil-Ja Hwang blends elements of dance and music from the classic Japanese Noh play ''Dojoji'' with what she describes as multimedia technology, including live 3-D video. At 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $25. (Dunning) * DIANNE McINTYRE AND OLU DARA (Sunday) Ms. McIntyre and Mr. Dara are two of a kind. Or one, perhaps, given the seamlessness of their funny, imaginative and profoundly poignant dance-theater duos. Their program, ''Pieces of Pieces,'' offers a rare chance to see them perform together. At 7 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2206; $12. (Dunning) * MOMIX (Tonight through Thursday) A company that revels in acrobatic movement and theatrical illusion reviews a quarter-century in ''Momix reMIX.'' (Through June 10.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Jack Anderson) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The week's programming includes ''Three by Bach'' (''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Tribute'' and ''Brandenburg''), tonight and on Wednesday; ''Three Masters: Tchaikovsky, Balanchine, Robbins'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''Piano Pieces'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2''), tomorrow afternoon; ''Essential Robbins'' (''In G Major,'' ''Dances at a Gathering,'' ''I'm Old Fashioned''), tomorrow night; ''International Balanchine'' (''Serenade,'' ''Bugaku'' and ''Union Jack''), on Sunday and Tuesday; and a one-time lineup of ''Serenade,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' (danced by students from the School of American Ballet) and Balanchine's ''Union Jack,'' on Thursday. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) JENNY ROCHA DANCE THEATER/JASON DIETZ MARCHANT AND LINDSEY DIETZ MARCHANT (Tonight through Sunday night) The emotional and physical interaction between couples seems to be the theme of this double bill at Danspace: Ms. Rocha performs with her longtime dance partner Christine Poland in ''just barely,'' and Mr. and Ms. Dietz Marchant present ''Inflatable Man, Evaporating Woman.'' At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; members $10. (Sulcas) * SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET 2007 WORKSHOP PERFORMANCES (Tomorrow and Monday) Always a mix of radiant idealism and shrewd competitiveness, this event promises extra luster this year as it pays tribute to Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the school and the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. The young dancers will perform Balanchine's rarely seen but lovely ''Gounod Symphony,'' his ''Four Temperaments,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' and a new work by Sean Lavery, set to Mozart, called ''Twinkliana.'' Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday at 7 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-6600, sab.org; $40 tomorrow, $70 on Monday. (Dunning) * SITELINES 2007: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today through Sunday) This site-specific festival opens tonight with an outdoor performance by the Graham company of ''Steps in the Streets'' and ''Prelude to Action.'' At 12:30 p.m. (Festival continues through Sept. 14.) Wall and Broad Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M. 9 (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $20; $10 for children. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: 'CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED,' through June 16. This show, packed with obscure architectural gems, reopens on Tuesday. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, it relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Frédéric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava's 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep, wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Set on an incline between two highways, the building's heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What's refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaudíesque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through June 8. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente's relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don't so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith) * VALSAN KOORMA KOLLERI This Indian artist turns found objects, castoff materials and local stone from Kerala, where he lives, into large but delicate abstract sculptures. Copper vessels become containers for air and space; metal clock springs are woven into a time-rusted open-work basket; the simplest forms are ornamented with embedded glass beads. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, through June 16. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) OLIVER TWIST Each month this new gallery will rent its space to hip out-of-town galleries, a plan that could unsettle the home-away balance of powers in New York. The inaugural show, while something of a mish-mash, presents works by 29 artists represented by the renters of the coming season. Enjoy the sixth-floor space's Chelsea-like light and view, and stay tuned. Rental, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, through June 16. (Smith) Public Art MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) Last Chance * MEQUITTA AHUJA AND CHARLES RITCHIE Ms. Ahuja makes her New York solo debut with large paintings on paper of mythical beings,half woman, half animal, dressed in robes as brilliantly colored as the tropical fruit and flowers around them. Referring to the artist's African-American and East Indian background, the pictures turn marginality into a regal condition. The gallery also kicks off its new artist's book program with a display of sketch books by Mr. Ritchie, an artist based in Maryland. Each small book is filled with marvelous watercolors and all but indecipherable writing. Mr. Ritchie has been making such books for 30 years. They are extraordinary. BravinLee Programs, 526 West 26th Street, 2nd floor, (212) 462-4406, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: WORKS, 1971-1979 A selection of nearly 70 little-known early drawings and intriguing photo-works shows this young, restless proto-Neo-Expressionist overcoming the gravitational pull of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art, and broaching themes of the body, sexuality and the inner life that would blossom in his large paintings of the 1980s. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JOANNA MALINOWSKA Joanna Malinowska traveled to windswept Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic last year in the footsteps of the anthropologist Franz Boas, who studied the Inuit there a century ago. The subject of Ms. Malinowska's research turns out to be a Native American musician and Elvis impersonator named Jimmy Ekho, and the film they made together is funny and moving. For another video Ms. Malinowska set a solar-powered boom-box in the middle of the Arctic wasteland, where it will play Glenn Gould's 1981 version of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'' for as long as the sun shines. Venetia Kapernekas Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, (212) 462-4150, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE' I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)

German police clashed with hundreds of protesters in the port of Rostock on Saturday following a much larger peaceful demonstration against the Group of 8 summit meeting next week in a nearby Baltic resort. About 2,000 protesters, identified by the police as a hard core of violent activists, threw bottles, sticks and stones at riot police officers, on the fringes of a rally in the town's harbor area.

Putin said Russia could benefit from longer presidential terms, though he again ruled out remaining in office after the expiration of his second term.	President Vladimir V. Putin said that Russia could benefit from longer presidential terms, though he again ruled out the possibility that he would remain in office after the expiration of his second term next year, according to remarks published Monday. The remarks, made in an interview with a group of invited journalists from Group of 8 countries at his residence outside Moscow on Friday, further clouded the situation around Mr. Putin's post-presidential plans and his possible successor. The Kremlin published the text of the interview at kremlin.ru/eng/.

As leaders of wealthy nations converged Wednesday on a Baltic Sea resort for their annual meeting, the White House effectively derailed a climate change initiative backed by one of President Bush's strongest European allies, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The White House said it would hold firm against concrete long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a major priority for Mrs. Merkel, the host of the Group of 8 meeting.

Jim Clark, the former sheriff in Selma, Ala., whose violent, highly public attempts to maintain the status quo there in the Jim Crow era are widely believed to have contributed, however inadvertently, to the success of the voting rights movement, died Monday in Elba, Ala. He was 84 and had been living in a nursing home there. The death was confirmed by the Hayes Funeral Home in Elba.

They lurked in the woods, 50 strong, wearing black hoods and bandannas, and wielding tree limbs. At a signal, they sprang forward and threw their debris across one of the bigger roads here, creating a barricade that brought traffic to a halt. That little insurgency, and dozens like it, kept tensions high on the first day of the Group of 8 meeting in northern Germany on Wednesday. Several thousand protesters clashed with riot police officers, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking roads and railways leading to the site of the meeting.

The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) 'ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A' Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'FATE'S IMAGINATION' Sex and politics, a natural combination in real life, don't mesh very well in Randall David Cook's play, but his ear for humor makes this comic drama about a politician's son who has a fling with an older woman pretty entertaining anyway (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. Velina Hasu Houston's play requires the five actresses to portray their characters at every stage of their lives, and it works well that some of them actually are young, while others, like Ako, who plays the uptight, more-Japanese-than-thou Atsuko, are well into middle age. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Off Off Broadway 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Shakespeare imagined many things, yet perhaps even he wouldn't have envisioned this classic tragedy as a musical. The director Ellen Stewart has added many new elements, but the sum remains woefully less than its parts (2:15). LaMaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Claudia La Rocco) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL HER FACES: A PORTRAIT OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD' There's no accounting for fans, as proved by Anthony Inneo's loving but slight tribute to Springfield. If you know the lyrics well enough to sing along, you could do worse than spend an hour listening to some of that English diva's hits, barely packaged in the shape of a play (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C. (the Club), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MAUD, THE MADNESS' The familiarity of many quotations from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson has done nothing to allay my philistine sense of that poet as dated and uneven in quality. This dramatized version of his epic poem ''Maud,'' which he termed a monodrama, does little to dispel such prejudice. Although the actor Jonathan Tindle and the director Niegel Smith have made a prodigious effort to lift Lord Alfred's words off the page, the mad Gothic protagonist they create is unappealing, and his flowery words remain a monument to an aesthetic of another time (1:30). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. ( Midgette) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PHALLACY' Art and science collide in this play by Carl Djerassi, but it's not much of a mash-up; a chemist proves that a curator's prize sculpture has been misdated, and there's not much refuting the evidence (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'rosebud: the lives of orson welles' Cineastes will feel cheated by the Welsh playwright Mark Jenkins's effort to cover all the well-known triumphs and tragedies of this legendary filmmaker's life in under 90 minutes. He walks briskly and rests nowhere long enough. This is a one-man show, and Christian McKay, however, is Welles to the soles of his feet (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'THE FIFTH EMPIRE' (No rating, 127 minutes, in Portuguese) With this stubbornly static, talky drama about a young Portuguese king hoping to unite his troubled nation by embarking on a foreign adventure, the prolific 98-year-old director Manoel de Oliveira pushes his already minimalist style about as far as it can go. At the same time, though, Mr. Olivieira's aesthetic is in sync with his main interest: capturing characters' words and gestures in real time as they work through philosophical and political conundrums while remaining largely oblivious to the physical world around them. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'GRACIE' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Set in New Jersey in 1978, Davis Guggenheim's sensitive underdog tale depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school's all-boy soccer team. While connecting the familiar adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the pickup, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks an unusual degree of emotional complexity. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals LINDSAY ANDERSON'S MICK TRAVIS TRILOGY (Wednesday and Thursday) The British director Lindsay Anderson made three films centered on his everyman character, Mick Travis, played by Malcolm McDowell as a public school rebel in ''If '' (1968), as a disillusioned traveling coffee salesman in ''O Lucky Man!'' (1973) and finally as a hapless victim of the collapsing English health care system in ''Britannia Hospital'' (1982). Anthology Film Archives has managed to assemble all three features for rare sequential screenings -- no easy feat, because each film is controlled by a different company. The screenings begin on Wednesday with ''If '' and ''O Lucky Man!'' and continue on Thursday with ''O Lucky Man!'' and ''Britannia Hospital.'' The films continue in rotation through June 17. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image wraps up its retrospective of the vivid, visceral work of this tabloid reporter turned filmmaker this weekend with screenings of the restored 158-minute version of his World War II epic, ''The Big Red One'' (1980), as well as three rarely shown films from Fuller's late period: ''Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street'' (1972) and ''White Dog'' (1981) tomorrow, and ''Street of No Return'' (1982) on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE SINGER (Monday) A rare showing of Chris Marker's 1974 documentary about the French singer and political activist Yves Montand, presented with two short films by Mr. Marker, ''The Embassy'' (1973) and ''The Sixth Side of the Pentagon'' (1968). BAM Cinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; bam.org; $10. (Kehr) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Today through Thursday) A selection of notable recent Italian films continues tonight with the premiere of Angelo Longoni's ''Caravaggio,'' which stars Alessio Boni (''The Best of Youth'') as the tempestuous painter of the title and features cinematography by another Italian master of light and shadow, Vittorio Storaro. Among the week's other highlights: ''In Memory of Me,'' the second feature of Saverio Costanzo (''Private''), about a young man who enters an island seminary (tomorrow and Wednesday); ''Primo Levi's Journey,'' a documentary by Davide Ferrario that traces Levi's path from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp to his home in Turin (Wednesday and Thursday); and ''See Naples and Die,'' an examination of the city in all of its glory and squalor, directed by Enrico Caria (tomorrow and Monday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * LILY ALLEN (Tuesday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' With Kevin Michael. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. With Santogold. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is with hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tonight at 7, Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776, terrablues.com; $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with Kill Henry Sugar, at the Gershwin Hotel, 7 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (646) 207-0595, gershwinhotel.com; $10. (Sisario) EEF BARZELAY (Wednesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) BOOKER T. AND THE MG'S, SHARON JONES (Wednesday and Thursday) As the house band of Stax Records in the 1960s, Booker T. Jones and his crew had an incalculable role in the creation of Southern soul-funk, mixing musky blues with house-rocking R&B grooves built around the whirr of the organ. Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the vintage Stax sound. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, rivertorivernyc.com; Thursday at noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; both free. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * CARTEL (Tuesday) Those polished, punky riffs and bright singalong choruses straight out of the Blink-182 playbook are not the only signs that this Atlanta band isn't averse to blatant commercialism. Since May 24, Cartel has been inside a giant fiberglass bubble on Pier 54 in Manhattan, recording its second album in a carefully choreographed publicity stunt that involves an MTV reality show and Web tie-ins from Dr Pepper. On Tuesday the band emerges from the bubble and plays a concert on the pier. Presumably Dr Pepper will be on sale. At 6 p.m., Hudson River at 13th Street, West Village, (212) 533-7275, hudsonriverpark.org; free. (Sisario) THE CLIENTELE (Tonight) There's comfort in familiarity, and the soft, sweetly finessed songs by this veteran British indie-cabaret band, with echoes of the Byrds' gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison's breathy calm -- expertly channeled by Alasdair Maclean -- are a seductive sonic cocoon. With Beach House and Pipas. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) COWBOY JUNKIES (Wednesday) Almost 20 years ago this Toronto band released an instant classic with the somber and starkly elegant ''Trinity Session.'' And though on subsequent albums the Cowboy Junkies have never returned to that expressive peak, the delicate interplay between Margo Timmins's velvety alto and her brother Michael Timmins's muted guitar can be chillingly beautiful. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $40. (Sisario) DEFTONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Alternately glum and explosive, this long-running alt-metal band from Sacramento plays tightly compacted guitar riffs as the singer Chino Moreno howls and croons on themes of disintegration and decay. With Dir En Grey and the Fall of Troy. At 7:30, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $27.50 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) DUMPSTAPHUNK (Tonight) The MySpace image for Ivan Neville's new band gives an idea of where it's coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario) * FEIST (Monday and Tuesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the mellow indie-arty scene with deliciously melodic songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; sold out. (Sisario) * HAPPY MONDAYS (Wednesday and Thursday) Working-class hedonists obsessed with the highs of trippy dance music (and with other kinds of highs), Happy Mondays embodied the ''Madchester'' rave-rock scene in Britain of the late 1980s and early '90s. In its latest reincarnation the band plays as the centerpiece of In the City of New York, a two-day conference organized by Tony Wilson, the Factory Records impresario who discovered Happy Mondays, as told in the film ''24 Hour Party People.'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com or inthecityofnewyork.com; $35. (Sisario) LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good. Her band has made a splash at home as much for its smart and catchy new wave update as for Ms. Jackson's vintage skirts and ''Marlene Dietrich-meets-rockabilly chic,'' as one magazine put it. With the Virgins and the King Left. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BERT JANSCH (Sunday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. His appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' and interest from neo-folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart -- who both appear on his latest album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City) -- have introduced him to an appreciative young audience. With P. G. Six and Kevin Barker. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tonight) Founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Trumystic and Quintus. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $17. (Kelefa Sanneh) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to soft-rock's most incestuous hitmakers. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MELT-BANANA (Sunday) The hiccups of guitar and squeals of vocals fly by so fast in the hyperactive music of Melt-Banana, from Japan, that it seems a minor miracle that so many playful pop melodies survive. With Drop Dead and Children. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * NEVILLE BROTHERS (Thursday) Celebrate Brooklyn opens with one of the musical jewels of New Orleans, whose funk lineage stretches back to the 1950s, when the keyboardist Art Neville recorded ''Mardi Gras Mambo'' with the Hawketts. At 5:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) PINK MARTINI (Wednesday) The Hollywood lounge band gone global, this 12-or-so-piece ensemble from Portland, Ore., follows a retro glamour jet stream from Rio to Havana to Paris. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $55. (Sisario) JILL SCOTT (Wednesday and Thursday) Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. The R&B crooner Musiq Soulchild opens on Wednesday; on Thursday the bill is shared by a vocal powerhouse, Chaka Khan, and a current pop hitmaker, Robin Thicke. Mo'Nique is the host of these two shows at Radio City Music Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $69.50 on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Pareles) * STEELY DAN (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist.

(Pareles) JOSS STONE, COMMON (Today) The self-reinvention pitch behind her third album says that Ms. Stone is over her early phase of imitating 1960s and '70s soul. But on ''Introducing Joss Stone'' (Virgin), this husky-voiced British 20-year-old still holds fast to retro sounds, this time a high-energy soul-funk tinged with hip-hop. Common, the socially conscious rapper from Chicago, will release his seventh album, ''Finding Forever,'' next month, but he's already on the campaign trail, comparing it to the work of Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye. Also on the bill for this benefit for Central Park SummerStage is Ryan Shaw, who, in a smoking version of Wilson Pickett's ''I Found a Love,'' does the soul-revival thing as well as can be done. At 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; $40.

Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera, and offers Verdi with all of that love, so that some of the spirit of the opera comes across almost in spite of the variable skills of its performers.

(Anne Midgette) MET IN THE PARKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Opera companies are always drumming up new ways to attract a big audience.

At ''Bohème'' on Tuesday, Gareth Morrell conducts Hei-Kyung Hong as Mimì, Mary Dunleavy as Musetta, Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo, Dwayne Croft as Marcello, Jeff Mattsey as Schaunard and Andrew Gangestad as Colline.

(Allan Kozinn) CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) This annual three-week feast of early music, slightly spare yet charming in the best New England tradition, begins this weekend with what you could call song and dance. Tonight the vocal trio Liber Unusualis performs mystical songs from the 14th and 15th centuries; on Sunday Vivaldi's complete ''Estro Armonico,'' a groundbreaking sequence of 12 concerti, will be performed in the original chamber instrumentation.

Sunday's program juxtaposes Beethoven's ''Harp'' and ''Serioso'' Quartets with works by Anton Webern and Bartok's teeming Third Quartet. The Emerson, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this series, sounded in top form for the first concert. The one drawback is Carnegie Hall, which for all its acoustical glory, is not an ideal space for an intimate string quartet experience. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Anthony Tommasini) * ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tomorrow) Earlier this year Carnegie Hall, the Weill Music Institute and the Juilliard School jointly instituted a visionary program to train outstanding young musicians on the verge of professional careers and integrate them into the music programs of selected New York City public schools. The emerging artists have been showcased this spring in several concerts at Carnegie Hall. The next one is tomorrow night, an exciting and ambitious program with large-scale works by Webern, Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and John Adams (the Chamber Symphony). But the sponsors should strongly consider coming up with a better name for this talented roster of players. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org, $15. (Tommasini) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Tonight) This weeklong program of instruction, lectures and concerts, which ends on Sunday, has been dealing mainly with Beethoven's chamber music.

It denotes women who have sufficiently freed themselves of the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains around 80 percent male -- to achieve success. They include Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen and Joan Tower, who has organized the whole festival as a way to promote discussion and, on a practical level, a new burst of ''old-girl'' networking. The first performance of a commissioned work by Kati Agócs is also on the program.

Scores by Philip Glass, Tania León, William Bolcom, Robert Dennis, Matthew Harris, Eric Salzman, Gayla D. Morgan and one of the ensemble's singers, Elliot Z. Levine, are also included.

Tonight's program, ''Tradition and Innovation,'' also includes Peter Martins's ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' '' and, oddly, the Rosenkavalier section of ''Vienna Waltzes,'' by George Balanchine. Other programs are the ''one-time-only'' combination of Mr. Wheeldon's new ballet, Balanchine's ''Union Jack'' and ''Rubies'' from Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' danced for the first time by Megan Fairchild and the delicious Joaquin De Luz. Completing the week's repertory are ''Three By Bach'' (Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco,'' Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Brandenburg''), tomorrow night; ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' on Sunday); the Balanchine classic ''Jewels'' (Tuesday and Thursday); and ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (Balanchine's ''Raymonda Variations'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' and Robbins's ''Dybbuk,'' on Wednesday. (Through June 24.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p. m.

(Dunning) NOCHE FLAMENCA (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) It's back, with a new piece called ''Aldaba'' and the company star, Soledad Barrio, she of unfailing fire. (Through July 29.)

(Dunning) JODY OBERFELDER DANCE PROJECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. (Through June 17.) At 7 p.m., The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+; $175 to $250 for the gala on Wednesday, including reception and postperformance dinner. (Dunning) Pascal Rioult Dance Theater (Tuesday through Thursday) The company celebrates its 15th anniversary with two premieres, including ''EXP#1,'' set to an electronic score, as well as the return of ''If by Chance'' and ''Black Diamond.'' (Through June 17.) Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38. (La Rocco) SENS/NOÉMIE LAFRANCE (Thursday) Ms. Lafrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. (Through June 16.) At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale on the Hudson, N.Y., (575) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE MET: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in work he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman) THE NATIONAL ACADEMY: '182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,' through July 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative -- or ''traditional,'' if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Summer of Love: Art of the PsychedElic Era,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' By now some of the freewheeling, sometimes prankish specimens of photography styled Conceptual, rampant in the '60s and '70s, have become classics, as this wide-ranging show proves. The more than 35 projects on view, drawn from a private collection, include works by many of the usual suspects: Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Giuseppe Penone, John Baldessari and Charles Ray. Among those on display here that have stood the test of time are Nauman's witty explorations of his body, like ''Self-Portrait as Fountain'' (1966); Ray's ''Plank Piece I, II'' (1973), in which he helps a board make sculpture of his body; and Penone's ''To Reverse One's Eyes'' (1970), embellishing his sight through lenses made of mirrors. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through June 23. (Glueck) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, through June 15. (Glueck) 'SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT' This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters -- who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery -- dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo's ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden's ''Number 1'' (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through June 15. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street * PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn't think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism's fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism's pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector's beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through June 23. (Smith) Marc Quinn: 'Sphinx' This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society's obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: SoHo TINA BARNEY: CHINA VISIT Tina Barney's last series of photographs featured a nearly extinct species, the European aristocracy, while her new works look to China. Most of the photographs feature members of the creative class, from actors and dancers to a jingle composer, although several juxtapose the ''old'' China with the ''new,'' Westernized version, seen through the filter of opera performers or female golf caddies posed against an urban backdrop. These are more posed and less intimate than Ms. Barney's photographs of her own upper-crust East Coast tribe, which made her famous in the 1980s. But the implications of this project are obvious, with China's growing position on the world's political and economic stages. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, www.janetbordeninc.com; through June 16. (Schwendener) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS bilder Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) Last Chance JOAQUÍN TORRES-GARCÍA: 'paintings and drawings, 1920-1942' This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-García ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' . This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190; closes today. (Smith) MARGUERITE ZORACH: A LIFE IN ART The first solo show in more than 30 years of a pioneer of European modernism in America contains 35 paintings -- landscapes, portraits and still lifes -- ranging in date from 1910 to the mid-1960s. They're not all equally good, but they all have a quality of grit, intelligence and striving that never falters. The next show should also include her textiles and works on paper. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, www.gpgallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

A 41-year-old man was killed and 14 people were injured as rival fans swinging metal pipes and throwing rocks clashed yesterday after a match between Argentine clubs in Buenos Aires.At least 78 arrests were reported in the fighting, which spilled onto a busy rush-hour freeway after Tigre defeated Nueva Chicago, 2-1, which was relegated from Argentina's first division.The police, who appeared initially overwhelmed by the fighting, were backed up by reinforcements firing tear gas and rubber bullets as rock-throwing fans scattered from the stadium in the Mataderos section of the capital.

Hungry victims of floods in southwestern Pakistan rioted, protesting slow, meager aid reaching their marooned villages. The police fired tear gas and shots into the air but failed to disperse a crowd of several thousand villagers in Turbat who had broken into and ransacked the mayor's office. The widespread flooding struck after a cyclone dumped torrential rains on the area on Tuesday. Khubah Bakhsh, the relief commissioner for Baluchistan, estimated that 200,000 houses had been destroyed or damaged. Protesters said they had waded through chest-deep water from outlying areas to voice their anger about the dearth of relief aid. Many said the only aid they had received was packets of biscuits and bottles of water. Military helicopters continued to drop relief supplies, but many of the more than 800,000 people affected by the flooding, many of them homeless, appeared to have received little or nothing. In Turbat City and surrounding villages, the first relief supplies began arriving only on Thursday. From a helicopter, a reporter saw just the tops of palm trees protruding from vast sheets of water in some areas. People, cows and goats were stranded on rooftops without water or food, in 109-degree heat.

A months-long standoff between the Pakistani government and Islamic militants holed up in a mosque in the heart of the capital erupted in violence on Tuesday.

Reports also emerged Thursday evening that the hold-out cleric leading the rebellion was offering to surrender. The government kept up its pressure on the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, demanding the unconditional surrender of the estimated 400 to 500 people still inside, as many as half of them female students and teachers. Army and police commandos have surrounded the complex and barred access since heavy clashes with armed followers on Tuesday.

Sheik Hasina Wazed, who led the government from 1996 to 2001, was arrested by hundreds of police officers and members of the special forces in a dawn raid on her home and jailed on charges of extortion, which she has repeatedly denied.

ART 'GLENN LIGON: UNAUTHORIZED' Famous for conceptual work that relishes and parodies racial stereotypes and cultural insensitivity, the gay African-American artist Glenn Ligon, 47, has not had a solo show in New York for four years. He returns, to the Bill Hodges Gallery, with a blistering assembly of works in various mediums from the last couple of decades, among them a pair of closely observed black-and-white screen prints on canvas of the back of his shaved head, above. They resemble studies in phrenology, a pseudoscience sometimes used to justify racism. There is also a nice selection of black-and-white text paintings, including ''Untitled (Crowd/The Fire Next Time)'' (2000), a photographic image of an African-American crowd at a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in 1995 overlaid with a silkscreen in glistening coal dust of an excerpt from ''The Fire Next Time'' by James Baldwin. The text reads: ''Something in me wondered, 'What will happen to all the beauty?,' '' in this context suggesting a gentle satire of protest rallies and the civil rights cause. Mr. Ligon's appetite for traversing racial stereotypes finds vivid expression in his narratives, etchings on handmade paper purporting to be the title page of testimonials on his intrepid life and adventures among white people in the art world. They make you laugh, but like all good socially or politically engaged art, the pieces also have the underappreciated virtue of momentarily letting the viewer see the world through someone else's eyes.

A suicide bomber killed at least 13 people here in the capital on Friday as hundreds of angry protesters clashed with the police when the government tried to reopen for prayers a militant mosque that was the scene of a violent siege this month. The suicide attack took place in a crowded marketplace as protesters, many of them former students of the Red Mosque's religious schools, held up blood-stained rubble and shawls shredded with bullet holes from the eight-day siege. They demanded that Maulana Abdul Aziz, one of the clerics who led the standoff and was arrested trying to flee in a burqa, be brought back to lead Friday Prayer.

President Bush met in a wooded resort east of here on Monday with his counterparts to the north and the south -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Felipe Calderón of Mexico -- to discuss the drafting of emergency border provisions, the stalled international trade talks, and immigration. But Hurricane Dean's expected landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico threw into doubt three-way talks that were scheduled for Tuesday. Mr. Calderón said Monday that he would return home early Tuesday to be on hand to deal with any fallout from the storm, and organizers of the meeting were scrambling to accommodate him.

Students at Dhaka University, fed up with having the army on campus, burned a military van and damaged at least 50 vehicles, witnesses said. At least 150 students were hurt after the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the stone-throwing and stick-wielding students. More than 100 students were wounded in similar clashes on Monday. As reports of the Dhaka University violence spread, unrest spread to at least four other universities. Late yesterday, the army-backed interim government said it had ordered all its troops to withdraw from the Dhaka campus. Protests and street assemblies have been banned since the interim government took power on Jan. 12, after months of political violence around the country. Troops have been camping in the university gymnasium since then. The campus unrest was the first major defiance of the government restrictions.

The police used tear gas, water cannons and clubs against demonstrators staging nationwide protests over government social and economic policies. The authorities said 372 people had been detained in the daylong protests, which spread in the capital, Santiago, from downtown to several working-class districts. The Santiago regional governor, Adriana Delpiano, said 50 demonstrators and 18 police officers were injured. Among the injured was Senator Alejandro Navarro, of President Michelle Bachelet's Socialist Party, who bled from the back of the head after being clubbed by a police officer. Mr. Navarro was supporting the protest called by the country's largest union federation to oppose free-market economics and the government's social policies. Protest organizers called for higher pensions and better education, health and housing services.

ART '25 YEARS LATER: WELCOME TO ART IN GENERAL' To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the scruffy, downtown, nonprofit art space Art in General is presenting a dozen newly commissioned installations by artists who have participated in its recent programs at the well-heeled Midtown gallery of UBS, one of the world's leading financial firms. It is an unorthodox partnership, though there is something immensely appealing about the idea of experimental art invading this sterile corporate environment. A handful of the artworks even poke fun at corporate culture and greed, including Ana Prvacki's mock money-laundering service (complete with a promotional video); the Dutch collective Bik Van der Pol's installation inspired by an out-of-print guidebook, ''How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found''; and Lee Walton's hiring of an actor to hang around the gallery's 51st Street entrance for an hour each day, pretending to be an office worker at lunch. Bleachers are provided nearby for viewers in the know.

In September 1968, Hillary Diane Rodham, role model and student government president, was addressing Wellesley College freshmen girls -- back when they were still called ''girls'' -- about methods of protest. It was a hot topic in that overheated year of what she termed ''confrontation politics from Chicago to Czechoslovakia.'' ''Dynamism is a function of change,'' Ms. Rodham said in her speech. ''On some campuses, change is effected through nonviolent or even violent means. Although we too have had our demonstrations, change here is usually a product of discussion in the decision-making process.''

In its latest decision overruling Israel's influential security establishment, the High Court of Justice here on Tuesday ordered the government to reroute a section of its separation barrier that had split a West Bank village from much of its farmland. Although this is not the first time that Israel's High Court has ruled in the Palestinians' favor in a case about the barrier, this case has taken on a special significance as a symbol of popular resistance to construction of the barrier. In the past two and a half years, residents of the village, Bilin, and a band of Israeli far-leftists and foreign supporters have held weekly demonstrations in the fields and groves along the barrier route, often ending in confrontations with Israeli forces.

Guards at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility used tear gas to break up a fight involving nearly two dozen inmates on Monday night, state corrections officials said yesterday. Officials said that it was the second time in a week that guards had to use gas to stop a brawl at Great Meadow, a maximum-security state prison about 70 miles north of Albany. No guards were hurt in the melee, which took place about 8 p.m. in a recreation yard, said Scott Bishop, a spokesman for the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, a union that represents prison guards. The brawl appeared to be part of a gang dispute and was similar to a fight on Sept. 3, he said.

Stepping up their challenge to the military government, Buddhist monks staged a second straight day of protests Wednesday, briefly occupying a landmark pagoda in Yangon, the main city, during one of several marches around the country. In the western city of Sittwe, some 5,000 monks were said to have turned out for an anti-government demonstration even though a protest the previous day had been cut short when the authorities fired tear gas and warning shots.

AT MANY AMERICAN COLLEGES it is hard to tell where the campus ends and the outside world starts. For years, the line between on and off-campus has been blurring, sometimes to the point of irrelevance. For parents accompanying their children across this indistinct border today, I imagine that a dose of nostalgia must no doubt be mixed with a hefty helping of genuine shock. Where are the protesters? No hunger strikes or marches? No barricades or tear gas? On many campuses even the time-honored Frisbee toss is on the way out and the newer dormitories proudly bear the designation "Riot Proof." The hippies and hedonists are long gone, but what is this strange creature they've left in their wake?

It's 10 a.m. Outside the trees sway across the gray sky with the cool, brisk winds allowing the naked branches to brush up against the large glass windows. Slowly students begin to creep inside the building, down the hall, down the stairs, and out of the auditoriums. The time has come. There will be ten minutes between classes for me and my colleagues to go into the swarm of students and make as many people aware of our campaign and why it's important to ensure that University of Michigan apparel is not made in sweatshops. The results are minimal. A girl wearing Uggs enters the building, sees me with a flier and clipboard, and walks faster to avoid me. So does the young man wearing his fraternity letters, the punk rocker with his headphones, the stoner with dreadlocks and the hunched-over engineer. Those that I manage to talk to, nod their heads nonchalantly and look around to see if they see their friends, occasionally glancing at their wristwatch. Sometimes they skip all of that and ask just to sign the petition, without knowing what it concerns.

"College as America used to understand it is coming to an end"... and good riddance I say. Mr. Perlstein pushes this quote as a thesis within his commentary. And guess what? It gives off an extremely negative connotation. His piece is after all titled, "What's the Matter with College?" and goes on to suggest that contemporary students have a bad case of intellectual impotence. While I agree with Mr. Perlstein in his point that the perception of college in America is changing, what I disagree with is his argument- that the result of this is something to lament. The decline of higher education's effect on the national culture is actually giving way to something much more significant, a growing consciousness that enables discussion rather than demonstration.

The gathering of protestors at the base of Bascom Hill, the iconic center of the University of Wisconsin campus, featured a carnival atmosphere on the morning of October 18, 1967. An Uncle Sam on stilts teetered above the crowd, another activist impersonated President Johnson and the San Francisco Mime Troupe appeared in whiteface as the Guerrilla Marching Band. Activists banged tambourines while students assembled to stage an obstructive sit-in at the building where recruiters from Dow Chemical Company, the military's supplier of napalm, were conducting placement interviews, as David Maraniss described the scene in They Marched Into Sunlight. The crowd of protestors had grown to well over a thousand by noon, and around 1:30 p.m., police forced their way in to clear the building. What happened next shocked the city and eventually the nation, as the churning mass of students inside the building fell like grain under the scything of police batons. Forty-seven students w ere treated at the university medical center that day, and many more left with eyes reddened by tear gas, released for the first time ever on the campus. Madison soon became known as one of the most anti-war campuses in America, considered by some to be the Berkeley of the Midwest. Madison saw protests again at the start of the build-up to the Iraq War, but nothing that could match the Vietnam protests for violence or cultural significance. In this, the campus serves as a microcosm for the nation's universities as a whole, a barometer of activism that has fallen over time. And as the status of the American campus has descended to a tepid lull, the attention of the American public has waned. There are no more headlines about student protests. The nation no longer knows or cares what happens on these serene islands of academia, even though someday these students will be solving the problems created by a leadership that came of age in Vietnam. Former Wisconsin administrator Paul Ginsberg, who watched both the Vietnam and Iraq antiwar movements unfold, found that the Iraq protests were marked by a certain placidness that barely disturbed the quiet serenity that reigned over campus. The result was classic pothole theory, a catchphrase harkening back to the Vietnam era: Nobody goes to harangue the city council until a pothole appears on their street. In short, nobody's paying attention to college students because they're not causing any fuss.

ONE DAY IN EARLY JANUARY 1963, David Halberstam, portable typewriter in hand, appeared at the ground-floor apartment I was renting on a side street in Saigon. The front room served as an office. I slept in the second room at the back. I was the correspondent for United Press International, and David was in Vietnam for The New York Times. It was typical of the man that he did not ask, ''May I join you?'' Although wire-service reporters and daily-newspaper journalists often teamed up overseas, he simply assumed he would be welcome and set his typewriter down on the other side of the table I used as a desk. That day was the beginning of a partnership and, in later years after our assignments in Vietnam were over, a friendship that was to endure until he was killed in a car crash in California last April. There were no secrets between us. On days when we were both in Saigon, rather than out in the countryside reporting on the fighting, we would fix on a story we sensed was ready to be told, set off separately to see our sources in order to limit their exposure and then share everything we gleaned.

In several cities across Kenya, witnesses said, gangs went house to house, dragging out people of certain tribes and clubbing them to death.

Releasing tear gas instead of fog as planned, a Berlin theater sent its audience fleeing from a performance based on the 1928 German children's book ''Emil and the Detectives,'' Agence France-Presse reported. The mistake took place on Saturday afternoon at the Volksbühne theater in central Berlin, where about 100 people were watching the show. Several had to be treated for eye problems.

Nairobi degenerated into violence again on Thursday, as riot police officers used tear gas, batons and water cannons to push back thousands of opposition supporters who poured into the streets to answer a call for a million-person rally that had been banned by the government. But later in the day, Kenya's attorney general broke ranks with the president and insisted on an independent investigation into disputed election results. It was the first clear indication of the growing divide not just on the streets but also within Kenya's government about how to resolve a crisis that has ignited chaos and ethnic fighting across the country, killing more than 300 people in the past four days.

The pro-Western president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, was leading in the polls ahead of an election on Saturday that he hoped would restore his mandate to govern after he ordered a police crackdown on protesters and declared a state of emergency here in November. The dispersal of demonstrators on Nov. 7, in which more than 500 people were injured, though none fatally, was hardly unusual in post-Soviet politics. But it disillusioned at least some supporters of Mr. Saakashvili, whom the Bush administration has championed as a model of democratic leadership in the region.

If the price of cabbage is any indicator, things here in Kenya's capital may be edging back to normal. Before last week's election, a head of cabbage in Mathare, an enormous slum, cost 15 shillings, or about 20 cents. After the much-debated results were announced on Sunday and the country exploded into chaos, cabbage prices doubled. By Thursday, as the police tear-gassed protesters in the streets and gangs from opposing tribes hacked one another to death -- some of it right here in the sour-smelling, garbage-strewn footpaths of Mathare -- cabbage prices shot up to 100 shillings.

Suddenly, on that May day in 2005, the copter dropped CS gas, a riot-control substance the American military in Iraq can use only under the strictest conditions and with the approval of top military commanders. An armored vehicle on the ground also released the gas, temporarily blinding drivers, passers-by and at least 10 American soldiers operating the checkpoint.

THE violence that erupted in Kenya after a disputed presidential election on Dec. 27 raised questions for those planning a trip to one of Africa's most popular safari destinations. Is it safe? Can I postpone? If I cancel can I get my money back? Am I covered under travel insurance? Travelers have been surfing government sites, reaching out to tour operators and trolling TripAdvisor.com for answers. Many are getting mixed messages. Members of the London-based Federation of Tour Operators, which includes some of the biggest tour companies in Britain, suspended package tours to Kenya last weekend because of the political unrest and offered customers alternative trips or refunds. Meanwhile, many American tour operators have been insisting that business is operating as usual with safari parks open and airlines flying on schedule.

Protests cooled in Kenya on Friday as opposition leaders, still furious about last month's presidential election, announced that they were switching tactics from street demonstrations to boycotts.

President Felipe Calderón of Mexico will tour the United States next week, but he will avoid the White House, Capitol Hill and the presidential candidates, sticking instead to meetings with Mexican immigrants in major cities like New York as well as with a few local officials. That the president will have more meetings with his own countrymen than with officials in Washington reflects two political truths. First, Mexican migrants in the United States have become an extension of Mexico's own politics, and ignored only at great peril. Second, American officials have little use for meetings with President Calderón during an election year in which the subject of immigration has ignited strong emotions on the campaign trail.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- to say nothing of the violent confrontations between police and antiwar protesters that simultaneously seethed in the city's parks and streets -- can hardly be called an obscure historical event.

Some of the best accounts of what happened, what it felt like and what it all seemed to mean, were produced while the smell of tear gas still hung over Michigan Avenue. The nostalgic or the curious can seek out Norman Mailer's ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago,'' for example, which analyzed events inside and beyond the convention hall with its author's characteristic, and in this case perfectly appropriate, blend of intellectual grandiosity and journalistic acumen.

Serbs in the northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica fired weapons and threw grenades at international peacekeepers on Monday, wounding dozens of police officers and NATO troops. The clash was the worst violence since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17. The episode began at dawn when United Nations police officers raided a United Nations courthouse that had been seized by Serbs on Friday, and arrested 53 people. Capt. Veton Elshani, a spokesman for the Kosovo Police Service, said in a telephone interview from Pristina, Kosovo's capital, that several hundred Serbs responded by shooting at the police and throwing rocks and grenades, and that the police then used stun guns and tear gas.

Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China on Tuesday blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, for planning and inciting what he described as an ''appalling'' violence and destruction in Tibet last week. Mr. Wen said at a news conference that the attacks included killings, arson and the ransacking of public and private property and had seriously disrupted the Tibetan regional capital of Lhasa,but that Chinese authorities were capable of restoring order.

In the chaotic hours after Lhasa erupted March 14, Tibetans rampaged through the city's old quarter, waving steel scabbards and burning or looting Chinese shops. Clothes, souvenirs and other tourist trinkets were dumped outside and set afire as thick gray smoke darkened the midday sky. Tibetan fury, uncorked, boiled over. Foreigners and Lhasa residents who witnessed the violence were stunned by what they saw, and by what they did not see: the police. Riot police officers fled after an initial skirmish and then were often nowhere to be found. Some Chinese shopkeepers begged for protection.

Across much of the Western world, the Dalai Lama is known as the beatific spiritual leader of a humble community of Buddhists, beloved in Hollywood, Congress and the White House, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Chinese leaders cast him in a different light. They call him a separatist and a terrorist, bent on killing innocent Han Chinese and ''splitting the motherland.'' That gap in perception, which has grown immeasurably wider in the two weeks since violent unrest rocked Tibet, is breeding pessimism that Chinese leaders are willing -- or perhaps even able -- to embark on a new approach to Tibet even as it threatens to cast a long shadow over their role as hosts of the Olympic Games this summer.

What began as a widespread call for a general strike ended Sunday as the police cracked down across the nation, dispatching thousands of riot troops, arresting more than 200 demonstrators and fighting with protesters in the north. While two schools were burned and more than 150 people were reported injured in the northern town of Mahalla al-Kobra, it was the eerie emptiness of the normally teeming streets of Cairo that signaled the depth of discontent with President Hosni Mubarak's government.

Six Michigan State University students have been suspended after what the police characterized as a riot near campus last weekend, the university said. A party involving 3,000 to 4,000 people had to be broken up by tear gas after the police were pelted with bottles and rocks early Sunday. The event was held at Cedar Village, a student housing complex bordering the campus. The students, who were not identified, violated a disorderly conduct policy, the university said. They were suspended pending resolution of their cases, it said. Of 11 cases referred to the university so far, 7 have been reviewed for possible interim suspension. Six students were suspended, and one was not. Of the 52 students and nonstudents arrested, 38 face disorderly conduct charges. Others face traffic, drug, alcohol and noise charges.

The Army said it would begin destroying a stockpile of old chemical weapons found during cleanup of a training range on the island of Oahu. Army officials called it the largest concentration of unexploded chemical weapons ever found in the United States. Most of the artillery shells and other weapons contain the choking agent phosgene, and one holds an agent that causes a reaction like tear gas. The Army says the weapons were produced beginning in World War I and were stockpiled at the Schofield Barracks military base through World War II. Army officials say a transportable detonation chamber will contain the weapons while they are destroyed one at a time with explosives. Heat and a series of filters will neutralize their poisonous contents.

AT least according to legend, the ''events of May'' -- the strikes and disturbances that convulsed France in the spring of 1968 -- began at the movies. On Feb. 9 Henri Langlois, president of the National Cinémathèque Française in Paris and a shambling, revered godfather of the French New Wave, was removed from his post by André Malraux, the minister of culture in Charles de Gaulle's government. Young cinephiles reacted with outrage, and their angry protests flowed into a tide of political and social discontent that quickly reached the flood stage. Three months later the country was engulfed in riots, work stoppages and mass demonstrations. Some of France's most venerable traditions and institutions seemed to be under assault, and the Cannes Film Festival, the nation's glamorous and exalted cinematic rite of spring, was hardly immune. The festival came to a halt on May 19, after a group of filmmakers, including Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, professing solidarity with insurgent students and workers, rushed the stage at the Palais des Festivals and held down the curtain, preventing the scheduled screening from taking place.

It is midnight, and eight hooded figures slip around the side of a freight truck at a gas station on the outskirts of this northern French port. They wait in the orange half-light while one tries the locked truck door. It doesn't give, and seconds later the figures vanish among the dozens of semitrailers at this, the last truck stop before England. Most weeknights, smugglers lead clandestine migrants across the maze of highways that encircle Calais to parking lots like this, where drivers sleep before catching a ferry to Dover, 21 miles away. The migrants, who have paid the smugglers $500 to $1,000 to get them across the English Channel, will try again.

Forty years ago, French students in neckties and bobby socks threw cobblestones at the police and demanded that the sclerotic postwar system must change. Today, French students, worried about finding jobs and losing state benefits, are marching through the streets demanding that nothing change at all. May 1968 was a watershed in French life, a holy moment of liberation for many, when youth coalesced, the workers listened and the semi-royal French government of de Gaulle took fright.

Even without retrieving that bundle of yellowing French newspapers from the top shelf in a closet, it is easy to remember the night of May 10, 1968, in Paris. It is far less easy, 40 years later, to discern what it was all about. Adolescent hormones, the death of Communism, the death of capitalism or, as Andre Malraux suggested at the time, the death of God? Malraux may have been alone in invoking God's death as an explanation, but no one doubted that May 10 provoked an entire society to a rare assessment -- call it an examination of conscience, if you will -- of its fundamental values.

JUDGING from the news lately, Russia is well on its way to restoring that old Evil Empire image. Military parades have returned to Red Square. Key businesses are choked by corruption or are under state control. Journalists who probe too deeply turn up dead. And critics of the Kremlin are jailed, pushed out of elections or, in one instance, mysteriously poisoned. But on Russia Today, an English-language news channel begun in 2005 and financed by the Russian government, a more generous picture emerges. In this Russia, corruption is not quite a scourge but a symptom of a developing economy. And concerns about street thugs, poverty and Ukraine's aspirations for European Union membership trump fears over Vladimir V. Putin's grip on power.

Long one of the most-wanted fugitives in the world, Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader blamed for inciting his followers to join him in a brutal ethnic war, was en route to The Hague early Wednesday, according to the Serbian war crimes prosecutor. A motorcade carrying Mr. Karadzic to the airport left hours after stone-hurling nationalists clashed with the police in central Belgrade at a rally to protest his arrest last week on war crimes charges, and his likely extradition to stand trial before an international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

Indian security forces on Monday fired into marchers and killed a prominent Kashmiri separatist in an effort to stop thousands of protesters from the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley from approaching the disputed frontier with Pakistan, the Kashmir state government said.

Muslims angry about this week's killings of protesters by the police torched security bunkers and rioted Wednesday in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir's main city, as a conflict with Hindus over some disputed land continued. During funerals for two of the dead, others mourned, above. The police said that on Wednesday they fired tear gas to disperse thousands of Muslim protesters who had defied a curfew at several places across the Kashmir Valley. They said more than two dozen people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing protesters and the police. The land dispute began after the Kashmir government promised to give 98 acres to the trust that runs Amarnath, a cave shrine visited by Hindu pilgrims. Many Muslims were enraged. The government then rescinded its decision, which in turn angered Hindus.

Some 40 years ago, the cumulatively unbearable stresses of war in Vietnam, a revolution in civil rights and a series of unexpected, bug-eyed cultural uprisings sent America into a psychological meltdown. Norman Mailer wrote a two-volume participant-observer journalistic portrait of the experience -- ''The Armies of the Night'' (one of his masterpieces), on the antiwar movement in the fall of 1967, and ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago'' (a non-masterpiece, but good enough as a follow-up), on the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in the summer of 1968. The books, looked at today, are terrifying. ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago'' (New York Review Books, $14.95) has just been republished with an admirably self-effacing preface by Frank Rich. I have read it anew, and it gives me the willies. The blandly creepy triumph of Richard Nixon at the Republican convention, the six-hour line of working-class New Yorkers filing past the casket of Robert F. Kennedy, the Chicago police's running amok during the Democratic convention in that city, the National Guard, the tear gas, the dry police humor (''I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Mailer. But it's your reputation that you like to get arrested'') -- these are not the most serene of themes. But Mailer's journalism gives me the willies mostly because of Norman Mailer.

On Wednesday night, Republican delegates fresh off Gov. Sarah Palin's vice presidential nomination speech at the Xcel Energy Center here formed a conga line of taxis, buses and private cars to Minneapolis, where post-convention parties were firing up.

A small fraction of those people, perhaps 200, decided to take over the intersection of First Avenue North and Seventh Street. Traffic snarled, and delegates watched in waiting traffic as riot-clad police pushed the spontaneous, vocal protest up Seventh Street. A delegate from Texas said, ''Those guys, again?''

''Battle in Seattle'' is a film that leaves bruises. A visceral fictionalized account of the 1999 demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade Organization, it repeatedly plunges you into the kicking and screaming melee of peaceful protest gone awry. Cries rend the air and bodies crumple as police batons are swung and tear-gas canisters explode. This is what happens, the movie warns, when the powers that be are unprepared for the magnitude of organized opposition and impulsively lash back. Resistance gives way to fury, and fury incites chaos. The filmmaking debut of Stuart Townsend, an Irish actor, ''Battle in Seattle'' makes no bones about where its sympathies lie. Except for the anarchistic fringe, it is wholeheartedly on the side of the demonstrators, a loose coalition of grass-roots activists from the environmental and labor movements joined by students and other groups who opposed globalization.

At last, tear gas. Near noon, I was sitting quietly in my hotel room in La Paz when the TV screen started streaming live footage of a riot. The spectacle of protest and provocation is so traditional here in Bolivia that it could be the national dance. But this riot looked different from those I'd seen before. For one thing, the rioters were awfully well dressed -- some were in spotless white government uniforms, and more than a few women hurled abuses while wearing high heels. Of more immediate concern, however, was the location, the Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz. My flight back to America was leaving in 30 hours, and now the tarmac appeared to be in a state of war: gray clouds of gas rolled one way, waves of protesters surged forward, throwing rocks, and lines of policemen fell back under assault. As usual in Bolivia, the riot had started as a labor dispute. The day before, the airport administrator had threatened to strike over the payment of landing fees, causing some international flights to be canceled. Then, at 3 a.m., a mysterious plane had touched down, disgorging elite Bolivian soldiers who occupied the control tower and restored the central government's authority.

Thai riot police officers used a cheap Chinese tear gas, which contained an explosive powerful enough to rip craters in the ground, to disperse crowds of antigovernment protesters last week, an investigator said Monday. The finding by forensics experts and a human rights commission may explain why three protesters died and several others had limbs and feet blown off during clashes last week with the police, who insisted that they had fired only tear gas to disperse the crowd. The investigators determined that the police had used three other types of tear gas -- from China, the United States and Spain -- but had ''relied heavily on tear gas made in China,'' said Pornthip Rojanasunand, director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science. Tests showed that the Chinese tear gas contained high levels of RDX, a chemical commonly used to make bombs, Mr. Pornthip said.

Thousands of antigovernment demonstrators poured into the streets of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, on Friday, hoping to weaken the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili as it strives to maintain power despite a catastrophic war with Russia and a growing economic malaise at home. The large, though generally subdued, demonstration occurred one year after black-helmeted riot police officers violently quashed opposition protests in Tbilisi, pelting unarmed civilians with clubs and rubber bullets, and using tear gas and water cannons to chase the protesters from the streets.

During President Bush's acceptance speech in Madison Square Garden at the 2004 Republican National Convention, a San Francisco woman briefly interrupted the proceedings by standing on a chair and unfurling a banner that accused the president of lying. That protest set into motion a chain of events that has ended in one of the more unusual legal resolutions connected to the four days of the convention, during which more than 1,800 demonstrators and bystanders were arrested, most of them in street protests. Hundreds of them subsequently sued the city, saying they had been arrested unlawfully or detained in holding cells without access to lawyers.

ATHENS -- A fourth day of rioting erupted here and around Greece on Tuesday, as a 15-year-old boy killed by the police over the weekend was buried and the nation's shaky government grappled with how to contain the worst civil unrest in decades. While clashes between the police and students have been common in Greece for decades, the ferocity of the reaction to the boy's death took the nation -- and its crippled government -- by surprise. Outrage over the death was widespread, fueled by what experts say is a growing frustration with unemployment and corruption in one of Western Europe's consistently underperforming economies, worsened by global recession.

He told miners that his ''heart hurt'' when he saw their city suffer, and promised to build a ski resort in the village of Gomarduli, posing with a gold-toothed grandmother who giggled in his embrace like a naughty schoolgirl. The day felt curiously like a presidential campaign, and Mr. Saakashvili was relaxed and happy. ''I never said anything about Russia, and they never asked about it,'' he said later. He reeled off grandiose plans, like a two-year campaign to teach English to ''every Georgian in every remote village.'' This was the old Misha, as he is known -- the dazzler, the wunderkind.

In the final days before a referendum that will determine whether President Hugo Chávez can run for re-election indefinitely, campaigning has taken on a noticeable, and sometimes ugly, edge. Antigovernment protests have intensified in some cities, despite government pressure, and pro-Chávez vigilantes have attacked institutions like the Caracas mayor's office and the Vatican's diplomatic mission.

Venezuela's opposition accused President Hugo Chávez on Friday of spending government money and clamping down on protests in the campaign to extend his term in office for at least another decade. Mr. Chávez visited poor neighborhoods in Caracas on Friday, the last day of campaigning before Venezuelans vote in a referendum on lifting a two-term limit on the president and other elected officials.

Hugo Chávez apparently doesn't believe Venezuelan voters, who just more than a year ago rejected his bid to eliminate the term limits that are blocking his continued rule. On Sunday, he is giving them another chance. For the sake of Venezuela's democracy, they should again vote no on changing the nation's constitution. Mr. Chávez became president 10 years ago as a champion of the poor and promised to combat Venezuela's vast inequities. He has since turned into a standard-issue autocrat -- hoarding power, stifling dissent, spending the nation's oil wealth on political support.

President Hugo Chávez handily won a referendum on Sunday that will end presidential term limits, allowing him to run for re-election indefinitely and injecting fresh vibrancy into his socialist-inspired revolution. The results, coming after voters had rejected a similar effort by Mr. Chávez just 15 months ago, pointed to his resilience after a decade in power, as well as to the fragmentation of his opposition, which as recently as November had won key mayoralties and governorships.

The Pakistani government agreed early on Monday to reinstate the independent-minded former chief justice of the Supreme Court, a stunning concession to the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, who had been heading toward the capital in a convoy threatening to stage a mass protest over the issue after he broke free from house arrest at his residence near here. The concession, broadcast on national television by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, came after a tumultuous weekend in Pakistani politics in which a dispute between President Asif Ali Zardari and Mr. Sharif escalated into a crisis that was destabilizing nuclear-armed Pakistan, already under pressure from a growing Islamic insurgency and severe economic troubles.

Neighborhood children taunted the police. The police fired more tear gas. There were smiles all around, not on the faces of the police, who were sweating and trying not to inhale their own tear gas. The people from the village were nearly festive, egging the police on, with rocks and slogans and the speed of youth. They darted. The police lumbered. Their tormentors got away.

The last time a president traveled to Europe during his first 100 days in office, perhaps the most enlightening moment of the journey had more to do with fashion than foreign policy. Stepping off the plane in Paris in February 1969, Richard Nixon had a moment of sartorial panic, according to his biographer Richard Reeves: " 'Here we go -- Vive la France!' Nixon said as he walked to the door to meet President de Gaulle at the bottom of the plane's steps. He saw that his host was wearing no coat in the bitter cold and stripped his own overcoat off before he stepped out the door."

And Asif Ali Zardari, with the job of keeping his country from becoming the most dangerous failed state in the world.	TO ENTER the office where Asif Ali Zardari, the president of Pakistan, conducts his business, you head down a long corridor toward two wax statues of exceptionally tall soldiers, each in a long, white tunic with a glittering column of buttons. On closer inspection, these turn out to be actual humans who have been trained in the arts of immobility. The office they guard, though large, is not especially opulent or stupefying by the standards of such places. President Zardari met me just inside the doorway, then seated himself facing a widescreen TV displaying an image of fish swimming in a deep blue sea. His party spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, and his presidential spokesman, Farahnaz Ispahani, sat facing him, almost as rigid as the soldiers. Zardari is famous for straying off message and saying odd things or jumbling facts and figures. He is also famous for blaming his aides when things go wrong -- and things have been going wrong quite a lot lately. Zardari's aides didn't want him to talk to me. Now they were tensely waiting for a mishap. The president himself, natty in a navy suit, his black hair brilliantined to a sheen, was the very picture of ease. Zardari beamed when we talked about New York, where he often lived between 2004, when he was released from prison after eight years, and late 2007, when he returned to Pakistan not long after his wife, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated by terrorists. For all that painful recent history, Zardari is a suave and charming man with a sly grin, and he gives the impression of thoroughly enjoying what must be among the world's least desirable jobs. Zardari had just been through the most dangerous weeks of his six months in office. He dissolved the government in Punjab, Pakistan's dominant state, and called out the police to stop the country's lawyers and leading opposition party from holding a ''long march'' to demand the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been sacked, along with most of the high judiciary, by Zardari's predecessor, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Zardari defused the situation only by allowing Chaudhry's return to office and giving in to other demands that he had previously and repeatedly rejected.

L'AQUILA, ITALY -- As demonstrations against the Group of 8 countries go, the protest march organized by anti-globalization groups here Friday was remarkably subdued.

The demonstration was unusually small, too, for an international event -- 7,000 participants according to organizers, 2,000 according to the police. But from the offset, the organizers had not wanted to drum up big numbers to not add to the discomfort of the tens of thousands of people living in tents.

BEIJING -- At least five people have been killed and 14 have been wounded or hospitalized during days of protests by ethnic Han demanding a government clampdown on Uighurs in the capital of the restive western region of Xinjiang, according to the state news agency, which cited the city's deputy mayor. The deputy mayor, Zhang Hong, gave the casualty toll at a news conference late Friday night in Urumqi, the regional capital. The state news agency, Xinhua, did not report the ethnicities of the victims and had no other details. Urumqi remained paralyzed Friday as Han protesters continued to rally in parts of the city to call for greater security measures against alleged Uighur attacks, forcing the government to close schools, offices and shops to keep people off the streets and to block traffic from the city center. The police used tear gas to disperse protesters, and loud booms from the firing of gas canisters could be heard from the city center, witnesses said.

Ten years ago, I was given an assignment to write an article on bullying for Mademoiselle. This was not long after Columbine and bullying - presumed then to have driven the shooters to murder-suicide - was a hot topic. My own special contribution to the national conversation would involve making contact with a girl I'll call X, whom I recalled as having been particularly cruel to me in 7th and 8th grades. I was going to confront X about this and find out what she had been feeling at the time and how she had turned out.

Impatience was clearly rising Tuesday at global climate negotiations here as delegates struggled without success to surmount disputes over issues like emissions targets and financial aid for developing countries. With less than four days left in the two-week conference, a new draft negotiating text circulating among delegates reflected the wide gulf over those issues and others like monitoring emissions of heat-trapping gases. The United States and China remained at a tense impasse over China's refusal to accept international monitoring on its turf.

Thousands of Maoist protesters in Nepal enforced the second day of their nationwide general strike on Monday, shouting antigovernment slogans and paralyzing much of the country as businesses remained closed and vehicle traffic was almost nonexistent in the capital, Katmandu. The quieter protests on Monday contrasted with the violent clashes that erupted a day earlier between the police and demonstrators in Katmandu. On Sunday, the police arrested at least 70 people as officers used batons and tear gas to break up protesters, who were blocking roads and preventing Nepal's prime minister from reaching his residence after returning from the international climate change talks in Copenhagen.

After two weeks of often chaotic food distribution, the United Nations announced plans on Saturday for a coupon-based system that aims to give rice to 10,000 Haitians a day at each of 16 locations around Port-au-Prince. The new program -- with the first coupons delivered Saturday, and food to be distributed Sunday -- ends what officials described as the ''quick and dirty'' initial phase of emergency response, but it is also an admission of what Haitians were saying for days: that the system failed to reach those who needed it and was often exploited by those it did reach.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A crippling strike by Islamist parties brought Pakistan to a standstill on Friday as thousands of people took to the streets, and forced businesses to close, to head off any change in the country's blasphemy law, which rights groups say has been used to persecute minorities, especially Christians. The law was introduced in the 1980s under the military dictatorship of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq as part of a policy of promoting Islam to unite this deeply fractious society. Many attempts to revise the law have since been thwarted by the strong opposition of religious forces, which continue to gather strength.

TUNIS -- The government of Tunisia scrambled alternately to appease critics and to crush growing unrest on Wednesday as a three-week-old wave of violent demonstrations spread for the first time to the capital, where swarms of protesters called for the ouster of the authoritarian president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The protesters came together after circulating calls to rally over social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Many were unemployed college graduates, and they angrily demanded more jobs and denounced what they called the self-enrichment of Tunisia's ruling family.

The official Saudi Arabian news agency said he arrived in the country early Saturday. The fall of Mr. Ben Ali marked the first time that widespread street demonstrations had overthrown an Arab leader. And even before the last clouds of tear gas had drifted away from the capital's cafe-lined Bourguiba Boulevard, people throughout the Arab world had begun debating whether Tunisia's uprising could prove to be a model, threatening other autocratic rulers in the region.

TUNIS -- New battle lines appeared to take shape in traumatized Tunisia on Sunday as the military backed the nascent interim government in what state media portrayed as a fight against security forces loyal to ousted President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, blaming them for the violence and rioting that has engulfed the country since protests forced him from power 48 hours earlier. State television reported that the military had arrested Mr. Ben Ali's former security chief, Ali Seriati, charging him with plotting against the government and inciting acts of violence. State television also said that a gunfight with Mr. Ben Ali's security forces broke out near a former presidential palace here in the capital, and that the military had called in reinforcements as it battled other security forces in the southern part of the country.

The soldiers smiled as protesters put flowers in their gun barrels.

CAIRO -- Tens of thousands of people demanding an end to the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak filled the streets of several Egyptian cities on Tuesday, in an unusually large and sometimes violent burst of civil unrest that appeared to threaten the stability of one of the United States' closest Arab allies. The protests, at least partly inspired by the toppling of the authoritarian government in Tunisia, began small but grew all day, with protesters occupying one of Cairo's central squares. Security forces, which normally prevent major public displays of dissent, initially struggled to suppress the demonstrations, allowing them to swell.

The justice minister, one of Mr. Ben Ali's former lieutenants, said the government had issued an international arrest warrant for the former president and his family on charges of corruption and enriching themselves at public expense. The interim authorities are also bringing to trial six former members of Mr. Ben Ali's personal security force for inciting violence.

Thousands of people defied a curfew, and Internet and cellphone service was cut off in Egypt.

CAIRO -- The battle had gone on for hours, and the end of the bridge was in sight. Somewhere past the green armored cars and through the smoke was Liberation Square. For miles the protesters had marched peacefully, shouting at balconies for their neighbors to join them. But water cannons and tear gas halted the march, for a time. Atef Badr, 28, turned to the retreating protesters with tears stirred by the moment, not the gas. ''I'm begging you,'' he screamed. ''All of you in the back, come forward!''

WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Friday put Egypt's embattled leader, Hosni Mubarak, on notice that he should not use his soldiers and the police in a bloody crackdown on the protests in Egypt, edging away from a close American ally whose cities have erupted in protest. Addressing the nation from the White House after a day of rage across Egypt, Mr. Obama said he called Mr. Mubarak and told him ''to refrain from any violence against peaceful protesters'' and to turn a ''moment of volatility'' into a ''moment of promise.'' Declaring that the protesters have universal rights, he said, ''The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people.''

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- In Yemen, the chants invoked Tunisia, a continent away. A Lebanese newspaper declared that all of the Middle East was watching Egypt. A long-dead North African poet's most famous poem has become the anthem of a moment the most enthusiastic call revolutionary. Since Sept. 11, 2001, conflict has pitted the West against the Arab world, as war in Iraq and Lebanon, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Bush administration's policies forged grander narratives of ''them against us.'' Last week, as more protests erupted in Yemen, Jordan and Egypt and as the United States remained largely on the sidelines, the struggle in the Middle East became firmly about ''us.''

CAIRO -- President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on power on Saturday as the police withdrew from the major cities and the military did nothing to hold back tens of thousands of demonstrators defying a curfew to call for an end to his nearly 30 years of authoritarian rule. As street protests flared for a fifth day, Mr. Mubarak fired his cabinet and appointed Omar Suleiman, his right-hand man and the country's intelligence chief, as vice president. Mr. Mubarak, who was vice president himself when he took power after the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, had until now steadfastly refused pressure to name any successor, so the move stirred speculation that he was planning to resign.

We set off chanting, ''The people want the regime to fall!'' and we were greeted with a torrent of tear gas fired by the police. We began to shout, ''Peaceful, Peaceful,'' trying to show the police that we were not hostile, we were demanding nothing but our liberty. That only increased their brutality. Fighting began to spread to the side streets in the ancient, largely Coptic neighborhood.

If there is a face to the revolt that has sprouted in Egypt, it may be the face of Khaled Said. Mr. Said, a 28-year-old Egyptian businessman, was pulled from an Internet cafe in Alexandria last June by two plainclothes police officers, who witnesses say then beat him to death in the lobby of a residential building. Human rights advocates said he was killed because he had evidence of police corruption.

IN 1972, Edward N. Lorenz gave a talk that turned out to be a landmark in the development of chaos theory. Its title was ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?'' Dr. Lorenz said that even a tiny action -- the flapping of a gossamer wing -- could set off a train of events leading to a violent storm in another hemisphere. This is ''deterministic chaos,'' the recognition that the world is so complex that certain outcomes cannot be accurately predicted.

WASHINGTON -- If the United States is, as so many presidents have said in so many speeches, the world's pre-eminent champion of democracy, then why does the drama unfolding in Cairo seem so familiar? A Washington-friendly dictator, propped up for decades by lavish American aid as he oversees a regime noted for brutality, corruption and stagnation, finally faces the wrath of his people. An American administration struggles over what to say, what to do and what to expect if the strongman is toppled.

It is almost impossible to convince yourself that a band of young men holding machetes, pipes and two-by-fours have only your safety in mind when they stop your car. Even after the 20th checkpoint, your heart still beats faster, and that tingle ripples over you until one of the men pops up your windshield wipers, signaling for the next group down the road that your car has been checked. This is what driving is like in Alexandria when the police have fled. We want to visit Sobhi Saleh, the former secretary general of the Muslim Brother/hood's parliamentary group. When we tell the final cluster of youths that we are going to see him, there are murmurs of respect. We leave the car at a makeshift barricade and enter a canyon of high-rise apartment buildings on foot. The elevator fits only two at a time, so we split up for our ride to the 13th floor. On Saleh's door is a small brass plate with Arabic script that reads, ''Sobhi Saleh, attorney before the highest court.''

CAIRO -- As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: ''Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion under your scarf for tear gas.'' The exchange on Facebook was part of a remarkable two-year collaboration that has given birth to a new force in the Arab world -- a pan-Arab youth movement dedicated to spreading democracy in a region without it. Young Egyptian and Tunisian activists brainstormed on the use of technology to evade surveillance, commiserated about torture and traded practical tips on how to stand up to rubber bullets and organize barricades.

MANAMA, Bahrain -- The police officers, 20 of them, raised their weapons and fired rubber bullets and canisters of tear gas directly into a small group of protesters chanting slogans and holding signs on Monday. One man fell instantly and was shot at as he squirmed on the ground. Another was trapped against a wall and writhed as an officer shot rubber bullets at him, again. That scene, on Avenue 28 around 5:30 pm, was played out all over this island nation on Monday as the police attacked peaceful protesters -- men, women and children -- chasing them down, firing at them with rubber bullets and overwhelming them with tear gas. At times the tear gas was so heavy, and fired with such abandon, that the police also succumbed, dropping to the ground to vomit.

Hundreds of riot police officers in Iran beat protesters and fired tear gas Monday to contain the most significant street protests since the end of the 2009 uprising there, as security forces around the region moved -- sometimes brutally -- to prevent new unrest in sympathy with the opposition victory in Egypt. The size of the protests in Iran was unclear. Witness accounts and news reports from inside the country suggested that perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 demonstrators in several cities defied strong warnings and took to the streets.

The demonstrators, estimated at several hundred to several thousand, marched to the city's central square, where they clashed with riot police officers.

King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain is the latest autocrat to choose brutality, rather than reform, to try to silence his people's demands for a more just government. His actions are unconscionable and miss the lessons of Egypt and Tunisia where violence only fed popular anger. Hosni Mubarak and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali are now gone. Protests in Bahrain were peaceful and festive on Wednesday when thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators -- including children -- bedded down in Pearl Square for the night. Hours later, hundreds of riot police stormed the area without warning, firing tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and shotguns.

MANAMA, Bahrain -- A brutal government crackdown on pro-democracy protesters here on Thursday not only killed at least five people but, once again, placed the Obama administration in the uncomfortable position of dealing with a strategic Arab ally locked in a showdown with its people. As the army patrolled with tanks and heavily armed soldiers, the once-peaceful protesters were transformed into a mob of angry mourners chanting slogans like ''death to Khalifa,'' the king, while the opposition withdrew from the Parliament and demanded that the government step down. At the main hospital following the violence, thousands gathered screaming, crying and collapsing in grief.

BAHRAIN -- There's delirious joy in the center of Bahrain right now. People power has prevailed, at least temporarily, over a regime that repeatedly used deadly force to try to crush a democracy movement. Pro-democracy protesters have retaken the Pearl Roundabout - the local version of Tahrir Square - from the government. On a spot where blood was shed several days ago there are now vast throngs kissing the earth, chanting slogans, cheering, honking and celebrating. People handed me flowers and the most common quotation I heard was: "It's unbelievable!"

In a nation of only 500,000 citizens, the sheer size of the gathering was astonishing. Tens of thousands of men, women and children, mostly members of the Shiite majority, formed a ribbon of protest for several miles along the Sheik Khalifa bin Salman Highway as they headed for the square, calling for the downfall of the government in a march that was intended to show national unity.

ATHENS -- Violent clashes between protesters and the police broke out here in the capital on Wednesday, as the two main labor unions staged the first general strike of the year against the government's austerity drive, paralyzing public services and disrupting transportation. Demonstrators estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 protesters turned out at two rallies that converged outside Parliament in the early afternoon. The numbers were not particularly large by Greek standards, but the mostly peaceful gathering was shaken when groups of youths broke off from the main body and fought with the police outside Parliament and Athens University. Dozens of youths threw stones and firebombs at the police, who responded with tear gas.

But when she saw on Facebook that the new prime minister himself would address the protesters the next day, in an unprecedented act, she could not resist.

Volleys of bullets fired by the security forces of the nation's strongman, Laurent Gbagbo, continued to sound around the clinic where the dead were taken Tuesday afternoon, as relatives and others pressed for cover inside the tiny building in the Treichville district. Three of the bodies lay on the floor under bloodied sheets, while a wounded man gasped in pain in the hall.

PARIS -- A powerful Iranian clerical body appointed a candidate backed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as its new chairman on Tuesday to replace former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, state media reported, strengthening the hand of hard-liners seeking to silence dissent. While the maneuver is unlikely to have a far-reaching practical effect, it will nonetheless bolster those around Mr. Ahmadinejad who have moved persistently and forcefully to quash opposition that surfaced in huge demonstrations after a disputed presidential election in 2009.

Witnesses described the small protest march in the eastern city of Qatif as peaceful, but an Interior Ministry spokesman said demonstrators had attacked the police before the officers began firing, Reuters reported. The spokesman said that the police fired over the protesters' heads, but that three people were injured in the melee, including a police officer.

A senior American diplomat arrived on an unplanned visit and sought ways to calm the chaos while pressing the government to exercise restraint.

''They shot at us and threw rocks at us,'' a protest leader who was at the scene, Boshra al-Maqtari, said by phone. She said there were about 200 government supporters there.

SANA, Yemen -- Yemen's pro-democracy protests exploded into violence on Friday, as government supporters opened fire on demonstrators in this capital, killing at least 45 people and wounding more than 200. The bloodshed failed to disperse the angry throng of tens of thousands of protesters, the largest seen so far in a month of demonstrations calling for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mr. Saleh declared a state of emergency shortly after the shootings, denying that security forces had been involved and promising a full investigation. The state news agency said the state of emergency would last 30 days.

Brutal police crackdowns followed, leaving six people dead and scores injured. In the largest protests, several thousand people gathered in the center of Dara'a, in southern Syria, chanting ''God, Syria and freedom only,'' witnesses said. They demanded the resignation of the mayor and the leader of the local branch of the security police. The police later opened fire on the crowd, killing six, the witnesses said.

That cynical bit of realpolitik seems to have led the king to send troops last week over the causeway from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain, where they backed up a violent crackdown on unarmed protesters by Bahrain's own security forces.

Rebel forces in the east seemed to consolidate their hold on Benghazi after heavy fighting on Saturday, and they began moving back to the west, advancing past government vehicles destroyed by allied airstrikes. EGYPT Voters overwhelming approved constitutional changes to usher in rapid elections to replace the Mubarak government. Results underscored the strength of established political organizations, like the Muslim Brotherhood and remnants of the National Democratic Party, and the weakness of new liberal groups. The Muslim Brotherhood said it embraced a swift return to civilian rule, but the liberal groups said early elections would lead to a constitution that centralizes power much like the old one.

SANA, Yemen -- The United States, which long supported Yemen's president, even in the face of recent widespread protests, has now quietly shifted positions and has concluded that he is unlikely to bring about the required reforms and must be eased out of office, according to American and Yemeni officials. The Obama administration had maintained its support of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in private and refrained from directly criticizing him in public, even as his supporters fired on peaceful demonstrators, because he was considered a critical ally in fighting the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda. This position has fueled criticism of the United States in some quarters for hypocrisy for rushing to oust a repressive autocrat in Libya but not in strategic allies like Yemen and Bahrain.

Tens of thousands of white Mississippians lined the route, greeting the festooned marchers with rebel yells of "Yiiiii Hoooaaah!" Women from the Mississippi Delta region, dressed in their Old South finery, rode on a float and sipped mint juleps as they toasted sending their men "off to war." The South that day, noted the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, "rose again, in all its Confederate splendor."

CAIRO -- Rejecting the Syrian president's latest effort to mollify them, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities and towns across Syria on Sunday, using a national holiday commemorating the end of French colonialism to widen their challenge to his family's iron-fisted autocracy. Security officers responded with deadly force, witnesses reported, including live ammunition fired at a funeral and the seizure of critically wounded demonstrators from a hospital. The protests on Sunday amounted to a brazen dismissal of the steps outlined by the president, Bashar al-Assad, only a day earlier in a televised address, notably the lifting of the country's 48-year-old state of emergency before the end of this week. The protests have posed an unprecedented challenge to the rule of Mr. Assad, who has clearly been shaken by the upheavals that have felled longstanding governments in Tunisia and Egypt and are threatening those in Yemen, Bahrain and Libya.

IMJINGAK, SOUTH KOREA -- On a pleasant spring day, with the wind breezing up from the south, the quirky little tourist outpost of Imjingak -- with its Peace Land amusement park, some souvenir sheds and a Popeye's chicken stand -- hardly seemed like a possible flash point for violent hostilities between North and South Korea. Imjingak, the site of a ferocious battle during the Korean War, has become a favored launching site for some of the South Korean activists who send propaganda balloons northward. The balloon campaign has so angered North Korea that its military has threatened -- as recently as last Friday -- to ''mercilessly'' shell Imjingak and other border towns if the launchings continue. North Korean artillery units are dug in a few kilometers away, just across the world's most heavily militarized border.

Fourteen people were killed in the city of Homs, they said, and hundreds were arrested. The breadth of the assault -- from the Mediterranean coast to the poor steppe of southern Syria -- seemed to represent an important turn in an uprising that has posed the gravest challenge to the 11-year-long rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Though officials have continued to hint at reforms, and even gingerly reached out to some dissidents last week, the escalation of the crackdown seemed to signal the government's intent to end the uprising by force.

CAIRO -- A night of street fighting between hundreds of Muslims and Christians left at least 12 people dead and two churches in flames on Sunday in the latest outbreak of sectarian tensions in the three months since the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. By lifting the heavy hand of the Mubarak police state, the revolution unleashed long-suppressed sectarian animosities that have burst out with increasing ferocity, threatening the recovery of Egypt's tourist economy and the stability of its hoped-for transition to democracy.

ATHENS -- Tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets here on Wednesday for a largely peaceful protest against the debt-ridden government's austerity drive, as a general strike called by labor unions disrupted transport services and closed schools and other public services. The one-day strike came as the government -- still struggling to get its financial house in order -- is about to unveil yet another raft of spending cuts and tax increases. But many experts are increasingly skeptical of Greece's ability to find a path to solvency without further aid from its European partners.

On a recent Wednesday morning, Zakaria Moh/yeldin steered his father's black Skoda sedan through a thick belt of Cairo traffic and drove northward into the sleepy farmland of the Nile Delta. Mohyeldin, a tall, broad-shouldered 27-year-old with a jutting chin and a thicket of jet-black hair, had just quit his job as a stockbroker trainee. The revolution was almost three months old, and the hard work was just beginning, he told me. Mohyeldin had seen his life transformed during those amazing 18 days: battling police in clouds of tear gas, ferrying food to the protesters in Tahrir Square and cheering in awe as Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's modern-day pharaoh, was cast out in a youth-led revolt. Now he wanted to see what he could do to spread the revolution's high ideals in Egypt's agricultural heartland. And he was vaguely contemplating a political career, starting in the village of Kafr Shukr, where his grandfather, a former prime minister, was born. He parked his car outside his family's old house, now a weathered brick meeting hall along a dusty road lined with vegetable and fruit stalls. Donkey carts bumped along among the cars, and date palms sheltered the lush green fields beyond. Inside the hall, photographs of his grandfather and other relatives adorned the walls. A group of middle-aged local men in brown and gray galabias stood up and addressed him with the respect due to his family: ''Zakaria basha.''

A day earlier, the king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, called for a national dialogue aimed at reconciliation, while also making it clear he would not tolerate any public protests. As the government withdrew troops from the capital of Manama early Wednesday, it promptly dispatched large numbers of police officers, who began massing at dawn in the areas where activists had called for protests, said Mohammed al-Maskati, the leader of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights.

NEW DELHI -- Led by a prominent yoga guru, thousands of protesters on Saturday staged a huge anticorruption protest in the heart of India's capital, gathering beneath a vast outdoor tent for a yoga session, followed by a hunger strike orchestrated as a pressure tactic against the government. The guru, Swami Ramdev, had been demanding that the government take various steps to recover so-called black money, the misappropriated cash stashed in foreign banks by some corrupt Indian politicians and business people. After a long, confusing day of speeches, yoga sessions and back-and-forth negotiations with government ministers, Swami Ramdev announced on Saturday evening that the government had acceded to his demands.

It was a fitting metaphor for the way that Greek financial institutions have been trapped in the middle of their country's turmoil.

That is one of two nagging questions that run through Marshall Curry and Sam Cullman's thoughtful documentary, ''If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front.'' The other has to do with the efficacy of traditional forms of peaceful protest. In the 1990s, frustrated by its inability to accomplish its goals, the Earth Liberation Front, a leaderless international coalition of radical environmental groups, turned to acts of civil disobedience and destruction of symbols of environmental abuse. Were these actions, which caused many millions of dollars' worth of damage, terrorist acts?

DAKAR, Senegal -- Stone-throwing youths took to the streets of this capital on Thursday to protest what they saw as a power grab in one of Africa's democratic bastions, forcing the president to back down. Tear-gas rounds fired by the police crackled through the streets, hundreds of people massed in front of the National Assembly and played cat-and-mouse with security forces, and chunks of concrete littered usually untroubled downtown thoroughfares. But the protesters let out a huge cheer late in the afternoon at the news that the president, Abdoulaye Wade, had scrapped a plan for a constitutional change that many in the crowd denounced as ''monarchic.''

BILIN, West Bank -- Residents of this tiny Palestinian village, along with Israeli and foreign supporters, on Friday held what organizers billed as the last of their trademark weekly demonstrations against the Bilin section of Israel's West Bank barrier. It was a milestone that illustrated both the success of the unarmed popular movement that was born here, and its limitations. The six-year campaign is winding down because the Israeli military has begun to dismantle the fence that separated the village from about two-thirds of its agricultural land. This is in belated compliance with a 2007 Israeli Supreme Court ruling against the country's influential security establishment.

His family figured he had gone off his medication for bipolar disorder, and a judge ordered him involuntarily committed -- the fourth time in five years he had been hospitalized by court order. When Mr. French's daughter discovered that her father's commitment meant it was illegal for him to have firearms, she and her husband removed his cache of 15 long guns and three handguns, and kept them after Mr. French was released in January 2010 on a new regime of mood-stabilizing drugs.

CAIRO -- Egypt's transitional military government announced the early retirement of more than 600 senior police officers on Wednesday. It was an effort to mollify thousands of protesters at a six-day-old protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square who have been demanding swifter justice for those complicit in wrongdoing under President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in February. The Interior Ministry said 18 police generals and 9 other senior officers were forced into early retirement because they were accused of killing protesters during the 18-day uprising. For the same reason, 54 lower-ranking officers were shifted to jobs where they would no longer interact with civilians, officials said.

Though the death toll was lower than in past weeks -- five, by the activists' count -- the scenes in Hama, in central Syria, and Deir al-Zour, in a drought-stricken region in the east, showed the tenacity of the protest movement, which, after four months, can claim wide popular support for an uprising against Mr. Assad's leadership.

On May 29, a young woman named Bushra al- Maqtari joined a group of several thousand protesters marching down a trash-strewn boulevard in the Yemeni city of Taiz. The Arab world's democratic uprising was five months old, and patience among the protesters in Taiz -- Yemen's second largest city -- was wearing thin. Maqtari had been one of the first and most fearless leaders of the movement. She is a remarkable figure: a 31-year-old university administrator and fiction writer, she is also a childless divorcee who refused, until recently, to wear the abaya, the all-covering gown that is practically mandatory for women in Yemen. Tiny and frail, she has a round, lovely face, with level brows and tranquil brown eyes. On that afternoon, Maqtari was standing in a crowd gathered around the city's General Security building -- an imposing six-story edifice flanked by guards -- when she heard cracking sounds. She looked up and saw that the officers on the building's roof were not just throwing rocks, as they had in the past. They were firing straight down into the crowd below. Within minutes, at least four people were dead and about 60 were wounded. Maqtari began running back toward ''Freedom Square,'' the intersection where thousands of protesters had been camped out for months demanding the resignation of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's strongman president. Then the real assault began. Armored vehicles, tanks and bulldozers began converging on the protesters' tent city from all sides. They fired tear gas and water cannons into the square and began shooting protesters at point-blank range. They doused the tents, which extended for hundreds of yards in every direction, with gasoline and lighted them on fire. None of the protesters had weapons. ''People were dying all around us, and there was nothing we could do,'' Maqtari told me. Some were burned alive. At around 11 p.m., Maqtari fled to her sister's house, about 200 yards uphill from the square. There, she and other protesters watched as flames engulfed the entire square, raging for several hours. Officers stormed through the local hospital and several field clinics where protesters were being treated, firing tear gas down the corridors, shooting up the ceilings and arresting doctors and nurses. Some thrust their gun butts into patients' wounds. Others were laughing hysterically, as if they were on drugs, Maqtari and others told me, and shouting into the darkness, ''Ali is your god!'' The next morning, amid the charred remains of the tents, someone had scrawled a sardonic reversal of the protesters' chants on a wall. ''The regime wants the fall of the people,'' it said.

Ugandan police officers fired tear gas on Wednesday to disperse thousands of supporters of the opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who had gathered to hear his renewed calls for protests against high food and fuel prices. The rally came a day after a court dismissed charges against him relating to his leading previous demonstrations. At least nine people were killed in the government's clampdown of the earlier protests, and Mr. Besigye was badly beaten by security agents. Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 25 years, had blamed drought and global increases in crude oil prices for the rising food and fuel costs. Mr. Besigye had challenged Mr. Museveni in a presidential election in February but came in a distant second in a vote he called rigged.

BERLIN -- There is no one whose thoughts European officials would rather read than Chancellor Angela Merkel, who meets Tuesday at the Élysée Palace with France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, as they struggle to find a lasting solution to the European debt crisis. The most common critique of Mrs. Merkel is that she lacks the necessary sense of urgency to restore confidence in the euro and calm the crisis. But a stroll through summertime Berlin makes clear why she remains so cool-headed. The streets are quiet and the cafes are full. Deeply tanned residents are returning to their jobs after vacations in fiscally compromised nations, like Greece and Portugal.

Tunisian security forces used tear gas and truncheons on Monday to disperse a crowd of protesters in the capital demanding that the government step down for failing to prosecute supporters of the ousted president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, left. Thousands of people also gathered for protests in towns and cities elsewhere, in the biggest show of popular anger in months in Tunisia, a North African country whose revolution at the start of this year inspired the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. ''We need a new revolution,'' said one protester, Mounir Troudi. ''Nothing has changed.'' Mr. Ben Ali has been tried and found guilty in absentia on charges including theft and corruption, receiving sentences of up to 35 years. However, many Tunisians contrast that with Egypt, where former President Hosni Mubarak and his sons have been put on public trial.

Election reform advocates welcomed the move, but some analysts expressed skepticism that it would result in significant revisions in time for the next election.

It is scrawled on walls, garbage bins, phone booths, doors and even tree trunks, as a city that was long quiescent declares these days that it will no longer stay quiet. ''We won't bow to anyone but God,'' says one slogan.

Protesters barricaded roads and burned tires in parts of Santiago, Chile's capital, on Wednesday as a two-day national strike demanding economic and other changes began, but copper mining was not disrupted and the government said 95 percent of public workers ignored the call. In several cities outside Santiago, however, stone-throwing protesters clashed with police officers in riot gear who responded with water cannons and tear gas. The strike, called by the main umbrella labor union, comes on the heels of huge protests by students demanding education reforms. Many critics of the government have railed against President Sebastián Piñera, a conservative billionaire, and demanded a greater share of the wealth created by a copper price boom. Chile is the world's top copper producer.

The military is drawing up boundaries around each settlement that protesters will not be allowed to cross and is carrying out simulated ''scenarios'' with the security teams, according to Shlomo Vaknin, the security officer of the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella organization.

Witnesses said Ali was in the crowd and was hit in the head by a tear gas canister. He died shortly after at the hospital.

It was past 11 a.m., and Abdullah was finally waking up. The night before had gone late, he and his friends challenging and daring and fleeing from the feared mukhabarat, Syria's secret police, who for the past five months have been bent on crushing dissent here in Homs. With a few hours of sleep behind him, Abdullah rolled off his mattress and began tapping out details of their exploits on his laptop. The clashes had been fierce and lasted hours, past the muezzin's call to prayer at dawn. ''We won't bow to anyone but God,'' the protesters declared. The mukhabarat replied with tear gas, buckshot and bullets. ''Hot'' was how Abdullah described it as he typed. As safe houses go, the room he slept in was lavish. A wide-screen television shared space on the wall with framed Koranic verses, rendered in sloping gold script. The hot wind of the Syrian summer billowed the thick drapes like sails in a storm. There was a mattress for each of the four men, all in their 20s, who slept surrounded by their smartphones and laptops and satellite phones and speakers.

The announcement of the new fiscal measures, made Sunday by Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos on the sidelines of an annual trade fair in the northern port of Salonika, came days after fresh speculation in the foreign media of an imminent default by Greece -- reports that Mr. Venizelos dismissed as ''a game in bad taste, an organized piece of speculation against the euro.''

Hours after 1,000 New York State troopers, sheriff's deputies and correction officers stormed Attica prison to crush a four-day inmate revolt in 1971, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller telephoned President Richard M. Nixon to claim victory unambiguously. At the time, it appeared that State Police sharpshooters who had fired on the prison yard had killed mostly inmates, not some of the prison guards who had been held hostage inside. And because the inmates were black and the guards white, the governor and the president seemed to suggest, the American public would undoubtedly endorse the state's assault on Attica.

They had in mind a muddy cellblock yard at Attica state prison where the blood had flowed freely 40 years earlier to the day.

But the effort is engaging a deeply cynical public.	KALANDIA, West Bank -- It is far from clear what will happen when the Palestinians go to the United Nations next week to seek recognition of statehood. But the initiative is engaging a Palestinian public that had become deeply cynical after 20 years of intermittent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Many Palestinians here in this refugee camp between Ramallah and Jerusalem said that they were excited by the prospect of their territory's being declared a state, but that they recognized that it would not immediately improve their lives. Instead, they braced for possible punitive steps by the United States and Israel.

Five months after the start of a ferocious crackdown against a popular uprising -- so sweeping it smacks of apartheidlike repression of Bahrain's religious majority -- many fear that no one can win.

Mr. Najib announced on Thursday that he would repeal the laws, the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention, and the Emergency Ordinance. Human rights groups say the laws have been used to silence critics of the government.

It was eerie 40 years after the deadly riot at Attica state prison to hear the voice of the late Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York employing his breathless signature adjective -- ''fabulous!'' He was speaking back then to President Richard Nixon and attributing ''a fabulous job'' to the state troopers hours after they took the prison in a barrage by rooftop riflemen who killed 10 hostages along with 29 inmates. The president is heard complimenting the governor for ''the courage you showed,'' their voices resounding from newly available White House tape recordings. A state investigation commission has long since quashed the celebration, establishing how reckless the governor was to allow troopers, some with shotguns, fire down through thick clouds of tear gas at the innocent and guilty alike massed in the prison yard. Despite what the Rockefeller administration insisted, inmates did not slash the hostages' throats; they were killed by state gunfire.

SANA, Yemen -- Firing from rooftops and from the back of pickup trucks, security forces turned heavy-caliber machine guns and other weapons on demonstrators here on Sunday, setting off battles between army defectors and forces loyal to the government in the worst day of violence in the capital since March. The violence left at least 24 demonstrators dead and more than 200 wounded in the Yemeni capital and threatened to scuttle any hopes for an accord between President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his opponents, who have been locked in a standoff for months over demands that he step down and transfer power. The fighting also raised the prospect of open and more intense sparring among factions of Yemen's divided military, which many here fear could lead to civil war.

Mugabe to help end a rift among the country's Anglicans, according to the archbishop's office here. Archbishop Williams, the spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans, wrote to Mr. Mugabe this year and urged him to stop ''the continuing bullying, harassment and persecution'' of Anglicans who support the global Anglican Communion rather than a breakaway group led by Nolbert Kunonga, an excommunicated bishop and ally of the president.

TUBA-ZANGARIYA, Israel -- The founders of this Bedouin Arab village in the Israeli countryside tied their fate to that of their Jewish neighbors even before the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948. The once nomadic Muslim tribesmen here helped defend early Jewish settlements in the area during the Arab revolt of the 1930s, local residents recalled. In the 1940s, they formed a strong alliance with Yigal Allon, then a young commander of the Palmach, the elite Zionist fighting force, receiving land in return for their loyalty and support.

CAIRO -- A demonstration by Christians angry about a recent attack on a church touched off a night of violent protests here against the military council now ruling Egypt, leaving 24 people dead and more than 200 wounded in the worst spasm of violence since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February. The sectarian protest appeared to catch fire because it was aimed squarely at the military council that has ruled Egypt since the revolution, at a moment when the military's latest delay in turning over power has led to a spike in public distrust of its authority.

ISTANBUL -- For more than three decades, Rachid al-Ghannouchi has preached that pluralism, democracy and Islam are harmonious. As his country, Tunisia, heads toward the first elections after the Arab revolts on Sunday, Mr. Ghannouchi, a renowned Islamic thinker, faces a reckoning between his principles and intentions. Mr. Ghannouchi boldly predicted Wednesday that his Renaissance Party would win a majority in the elections, contested by more than 80 parties, to choose an assembly charged with drafting a constitution for a country that was once one of the Arab world's most repressive. That would be one of the most startling achievements for an Islamist party in the Arab world since 1992, when the military in Algeria deprived a religious party there of an almost certain electoral victory, igniting a civil war.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- After weeks of cautiously accepting the teeming round-the-clock protests spawned by Occupy Wall Street, several cities have come to the end of their patience and others appear to be not far behind. Here in Oakland, in a scene reminiscent of the antiwar protests of the 1960s, the police filled downtown streets with tear gas late Tuesday to stop throngs of protesters from re-entering a City Hall plaza that had been cleared of their encampment earlier in the day. And those protests, which resulted in more than 100 arrests and at least one life-threatening injury, appeared ready to ignite again on Wednesday night as supporters of the Occupy movement promised to retake the square. Early Wednesday evening, city officials were trying to defuse the situation, opening streets around City Hall, though the encampment site was still fenced off.

Hundreds of protesters in New York City marched on Wednesday night to show solidarity with protesters in Oakland, Calif., where the police used tear gas to disperse crowds a night earlier. About a dozen demonstrators were arrested in New York, the police said. Just after 9 p.m., about 500 people left the Occupy Wall Street base in Zuccotti Park and went on a winding march around the financial district and City Hall, accompanied by drummers and a man playing the bagpipes as a helicopter followed overhead.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- For supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement, whose diffuse anger has been a defining and sometimes distracting characteristic, the wounding of an Iraq war veteran here has provided a powerful central rallying point. The veteran, Scott Olsen, 24, was critically injured on Tuesday night when he was hit in the head with a projectile thrown or shot by law enforcement officers combating protesters trying to re-enter a downtown plaza that had been cleared of an encampment earlier in the day. Mr. Olsen, who served two tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine, suffered a fractured skull.

When Jean Quan was an undergraduate, she once sat for 10 hours inside Sproul Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, demanding better treatment for minority students. As a community activist, she helped unionize hospital workers and organized parents in a poor neighborhood of West Oakland. At another time, Ms. Quan, the mayor of Oakland, might have joined the hundreds of protesters who have camped out near City Hall as part of Occupy Oakland. Instead, she is now a focus of their wrath. Late Thursday night, protesters chased her from a rally, shouting ''Go home,'' and refusing to let her speak. The protesters were reacting to her decision to shut down the encampment, which led to a night of street violence on Tuesday, with police unleashing tear gas on the demonstrators. Ms. Quan said the area had become unsanitary and unsafe.

NEW DELHI Since I was passing through India on a reporting project, I decided to drop in on Anna Hazare, the anticorruption campaigner whose admirers speak of him as the reincarnation of Gandhi. Kisan Baburao Hazare (''Anna'' is a Marathi honorific meaning ''older brother'') has been a figure in provincial Indian affairs for decades, but he galvanized attention this year when his threat to fast to the death shamed the government into endorsing reforms. I wondered what Hazare, as an exemplar of a venerable style of civil pressure, made of Occupy Wall Street.

As the death toll from an earthquake on Wednesday rose to 12 in the city of Van, the riot police fired tear gas and used batons to disperse scores of protesters angry at the state's relief efforts for a deadlier quake that hit the same area two weeks ago. ''How can you fire pepper spray on people who have already suffered so much?'' asked Abdulrahim Kaplan, 32. He said he had gone to a crisis center seeking a tent for his family when the police began firing tear gas. Thousands of families are living in makeshift camps as temperatures fall to freezing with the onset of winter. Some of those killed in the latest quake were buried under buildings they moved into that turned out to have been fatally weakened by the earlier temblor.

MONROVIA, Liberia -- Election officials announced on Thursday that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's only female president, had been re-elected by an overwhelming margin this week in a runoff vote that was marred by an opposition boycott. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf won 90.8 percent of the vote in the low-turnout election, easily defeating Winston Tubman, a former United Nations diplomat who said he was withdrawing from the race only days before the voting over what he claimed was fraud in the first round.

The Occupy Wall Street protesters had achieved a great deal before they were rousted from Zuccotti Park by New York City police on Tuesday morning. This ragged group, living in tents and tarps for two months in the financial district in Lower Manhattan, helped focus everyone's attention on the growing income inequality in this country. They made ''99 percent'' into popular language for the have-nots. They spawned protests against further enriching the already rich 1 percent, like those in Chicago, Boston, Oakland, Calif., New Haven, and even London. For two months, a confrontation between the demonstrators and the City of New York has been steadily brewing. Mayor Michael Bloomberg restrained the police and resisted political pressure for weeks, but he had some legitimate worries about crowding, drug use, noise and unsanitary conditions. His decision to clear tents and sleeping bags out of Zuccotti Park, the focal point of the protests, and have the area cleaned, was justifiable legally.

At several encampments, demonstrators who had watched the nighttime police raid in New York via live video streamed on the Internet and over Twitter and Facebook, said that while the Wall Street protest at Zuccotti Park had been their model and given them inspiration, they had no intention of halting their own demonstrations in response.

In a battle reminiscent of the clashes that led to the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak nine months ago, a mass of protesters converged on Tahrir Square, fled before an onslaught of riot police officers firing tear gas and rubber bullets, and then surged back to retake and hold the square through the early hours of Sunday.

CAIRO -- If the demonstrations that culminated in February were an uprising against President Hosni Mubarak, the revolt today is against his legacy. ''This is the real revolution,'' said Mohammed Aitman, helping at a first-aid clinic in a turbulent, roiling and, at times, ecstatic Tahrir Square.

CAIRO -- Egypt careened through another day of crisis with no end in sight as hundreds of thousands of people occupying Tahrir Square jeered at a deal struck on Tuesday by the Muslim Brotherhood and the military that would speed up the transition to civilian rule on a timetable favoring the Islamist movement. The agreement, which centered on a presidential election by late June, appeared unlikely to extinguish the resurgent protest movement -- the largest since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak nine months ago. The crowd roared its disapproval when the deal was announced at 8 p.m., fighting spiked on the avenue leading to the Interior Ministry, and the number of protesters continued to swell.

SEOUL -- Members of President Lee Myung-bak's governing party, coughing from tear gas sprayed by an opposition legislator, rammed a free-trade agreement between South Korea and the United States through Parliament on Tuesday, ratifying a deal that has sharpened a political divide between the government and the opposition and between big business and voters unhappy with deepening economic inequality. Lawmakers of the governing Grand National Party caught the opposition by surprise by calling a snap plenary session. Opposition legislators rushed in but were too late to prevent their rivals from putting the bill to a vote.

CAIRO -- The outskirts of Tahrir Square, the iconic landmark of Egypt's revolution, plunged into chaos on Wednesday, after attempts by the Egyptian military, religious clerics and doctors failed to stanch a fifth day of fighting that has posed the greatest crisis to the country since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February. The fighting in darkened streets, suffused with tear gas and eerily illuminated by the flashing lights of police cars and the floodlights of armored personnel carriers, seemed to stand as a metaphor for a political transition that has careened into deep uncertainty just days before elections that were supposed to anchor the shift from military to civilian rule.

The report, released on Wednesday, presented a devastating portrait of what it called disproportionate and indiscriminate force often used by the security forces to repress protests in February and March that were organized primarily by the Shiite Muslim majority in Bahrain, a tiny Persian Gulf state that is a prominent American ally.

CAIRO -- New divisions in the Muslim Brotherhood appeared on Wednesday as a senior leader hinted that it might walk away from a deal struck with Egypt's interim military rulers, reflecting signs of confusion and hesitation as the Brotherhood's most viable bid for power in eight decades has become tangled in the uncertainty and anger gripping Egypt's streets. A day after the Brotherhood agreed to the deal with the military that would speed the transition to civilian rule while also enhancing the group's own political prospects, the senior official said that the security forces had not fulfilled their promise to halt their attacks on protesters in Tahrir Square.

Then another and another, until no one -- not the idealistic youths demanding the revolution go on, not the soccer fans looking for a fight, not the downtrodden simply demanding something more -- could see across the street that had emerged as the arena for this week's uprising in Egypt. The pangs of violence that posed the greatest crisis to the country since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February ended Thursday -- for now -- as the Egyptian military managed to pull apart the protesters from the police. But, as tear gas still clung to the winter breeze, their legacy for the promise and peril of Egypt's revolution had already emerged.

The attack was the most serious diplomatic breach since the traumatic assault on the United States Embassy after Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.

Egyptians lined up this week to vote in the first Parliamentary elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The high turnout in a peaceful, orderly election contrasted sharply with the violence and chaos of the previous week, when hundreds of thousands returned to Tahrir Square after security forces killed at least 42 people and left 3,000 injured. But Washington should not be fooled by the peace that has returned to Egyptian streets. Even successful elections can not erase months of political mismanagement by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (S.C.A.F.) or the bloodshed committed under its auspices. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence in Tahrir, and has called on the S.C.A.F. to transfer power to civilians as soon as possible. That is a good start, but is not enough. Egypt's military rulers clearly believe that they have survived the political crisis, and have resisted calls for a more fundamental political change. The generals may prevail in the short term, as the numbers in Tahrir dwindle and Egyptians turn their attention back to the elections and political squabbles.

Their focus was not some underworld hangout, but a coffee shop, Costa Coffee, in a shopping mall. There was tension in the air when, suddenly, the suspects stood up, six women, and what did they do? They smiled and posed for pictures.

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Violence continued to flare in the Syrian city of Homs on Wednesday, despite the presence of Arab League observers who are supposed to be monitoring a withdrawal of government forces from the city. At least one person was killed there, but away from the gaze of the observers, the death toll may have been higher: at least two -- and as many as six -- demonstrators were killed in the city of Hama after members of the security forces fired on a protest, according to antigovernment activists. In images posted on the Internet purporting to show the protest, gunfire could be heard as several people carried a wounded young man.

ISTANBUL -- The Turkish military said Thursday that it had accidently killed at least 35 Turkish cigarette smugglers in airstrikes after mistaking them for separatist fighters in the Kurdish border region with Iraq, infuriating many of Turkey's long-oppressed Kurds. Most of the dead were between 17 and 20 years old. Political opponents denounced the prime minister, and angry crowds gathered in central Istanbul, hurling stones at shop windows and striking passing cars with bars. The police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them, Turkish news agencies reported. In several predominantly Kurdish cities in the southeast, security forces also used tear gas, according to local news reports.

Set amid ocean and mountains, Vancouver is not the kind of place you associate with anarchic violence. But through the years there has been a weird local penchant for rioting over canceled rock concerts, visits from the prime minister, economic summits -- and, of course, whenever the Canucks lose Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. So there we were June 15, a colleague and I venturing warily out of Rogers Arena through streets strewn with broken glass, burned-out cars and roving bands of hopped-up youths in Canucks sweaters. Not long before, we had been interviewing the celebrating Bruins, who were happily passing the Cup among themselves and their families. Now we were moving through the tail end of a riot that started among the 100,000 fans watching the game on giant screens outside the rink and spread throughout downtown, causing some 170 injuries and an estimated $5 million in damage.

On a recent winter evening, a gray Mitsubishi sedan made its way slowly down the narrow main street of Qalyubiya, a farming town in the Nile River delta, hemmed in on all sides by shouting fruit vendors, bumping donkey carts, strings of colored lights and tiny bakeries and butcher shops. Election posters were plastered to every available surface, and a voice squawked loudly over a distant, tinny loudspeaker: ''God willing, we will all soon live in an era of social justice. The revolution taught us that we are all equal.'' As the sedan reached a crowded election rally outside a mosque, the back door opened and out stepped a striking man with deep-set eyes and a broad forehead. ''He is here!'' someone shouted. ''The hero of the revolution!'' Almost instantly, a murmur rippled through the crowd, and the man was surrounded by adoring fans. A pair of burly aides grabbed his arms and bustled him through. ''God is great!'' the crowd chanted as he smiled and waved, making his way toward a brightly lighted stage. ''Freedom and Justice! Tomorrow we will be strong!'' The man of the hour was Mohamed Beltagy, one of the central protagonists of the Egyptian Revolution and perhaps the country's most versatile and dynamic politician. He is a senior leader in the Muslim Brotherhood who, unlike his peers, is also beloved by many liberals for his fierce support of the protests in Tahrir Square. But in a country divided ever more sharply between Islamists and secularists, his ability to straddle both worlds has only grown more precarious. He has been attacked by hard-line protesters for his association with the Brotherhood and dressed down within the Brotherhood for his willingness to side so vocally with the revolutionaries. Even his appearance sets him apart: at 49, Beltagy looks sleek and youthful next to the Brotherhood's bearded, pot-bellied, somnolent top men. He wears dark suits and natty ties, like a flashy Cairene lawyer, but he also has a prominent zabiba, or prayer callous, in the middle of his forehead, the ritual badge of piety in Egypt.

BILIN, West Bank -- Emad Burnat was born to the land and, like generations of his family in this hilltop West Bank village, he has eked out a modest living from its rocky soil. But six years ago, at the birth of a son, he was given a video camera and turned unexpectedly into the village chronicler. There was a great deal to record. Israel was building a separation barrier on village land that included some of his family's own. The rationale behind it was to stop suicide bombers, but the move confiscated most of the village's arable land and allowed for the expansion of an enormous Israeli settlement.

Egyptian activists and the military council that still rules the country are braced for planned demonstrations on Wednesday, the first anniversary of the start of the revolution that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. Since our coverage of last year's events was illuminated by online reports from activists who documented the uprising on social networks, The Lede discussed the anniversary with some of those bloggers.

HONG KONG -- Deadly showdowns between Chinese security forces and Tibetans in a restive region of western China spread to a second town on Tuesday, outside advocacy groups reported. At least two and perhaps as many as five Tibetans were killed by gunfire and many more wounded, the groups said, in what appeared to be the most violent outbreak in the region in nearly four years. The new confrontation, in the town of Seda, known in Tibetan as Serthar, was reported by Free Tibet, a London-based organization that advocates Tibetan autonomy, and by Phayul.com, a Tibetan exile Web portal. Their accounts said that Chinese security forces opened fire on a crowd of Tibetan protesters in Serthar. Free Tibet said that it had confirmed two deaths and an unspecified number with ''serious wounds,'' and that the town was under curfew.

The deadliest soccer riot anywhere in more than 15 years, it also illuminated the potential for savagery among the organized groups of die-hard fans known here as ultras who have added a volatile element to the street protests since Mr. Mubarak's exit.

CAIRO -- Egypt's military-led government built three new walls of heavy concrete blocks surrounding Egypt's Interior Ministry on Sunday. But they failed to stop a fourth night of violent clashes between security forces and protesters demanding an end to military rule. By late Sunday night, the fighting in the streets of the capital had grown more intense than at any time since it began after a deadly riot at a soccer match on Wednesday night. Thousands of protesters alternately scurried and swarmed through the streets, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at rows of riot police officers.

ATHENS -- After violent protests left dozens of buildings aflame in Athens, the Greek Parliament voted early on Monday to approve a package of harsh austerity measures demanded by the country's foreign lenders in exchange for new loans to keep Greece from defaulting on its debt. Though it came after days of intense debate and the resignation of several ministers in protest, in the end the vote on the austerity measures was not close: 199 in favor and 74 opposed, with 27 abstentions or blank ballots. The Parliament also gave the government the authority to sign a new loan agreement with the foreign lenders and approve a broader arrangement to reduce the amount Greece must repay to its bondholders.

Armored vehicles patrolled Bahrain's capital, Manama, on Tuesday in a security clampdown to deter protesters after overnight clashes outside the city on the first anniversary of a forcibly suppressed pro-democracy uprising. Youths threw gasoline bombs at police cars during skirmishes before dawn, prompting the authorities to send police reinforcements backed by helicopters into Shiite villages around Manama. The police fired tear gas at two dozen protesters near the former Pearl Roundabout, the focal point of last year's protests, nearly hitting several people as canisters bounced off cars. About 30 people were arrested, some of them dragged from their cars apparently on suspicion of being protesters aiming to block the highway near the roundabout. The prominent activist Nabeel Rajab, who led the protesters, was detained, as were six American activists in the country as part of a Witness Bahrain group to monitor how the police handle demonstrators. The government said in a statement that it would deport the Americans. Shiites, who were active in last year's protests, have expressed anger that they are treated as second-class citizens and that they are shut out of many state jobs under the Sunni ruling family.

Aside from concerns over his age, many are angered by what they see as a violation of the Constitution. The electoral code was revised, to impose a two-term maximum, after Mr. Wade came to office.

Bahrain imposed a security clampdown this week in a bid to avert mass protests on the anniversary of the Feb. 14 pro-democracy uprising last year and to prevent Shiite protesters from reaching Pearl Square, an intersection in the capital that became the focal point of protests.

The police fought running battles with protesters, who hurled stones, burned trash and set up barricades along avenues in the city center, forcing businesses to close for the afternoon. Opposition leaders say Mr. Wade's bid breaches a law limiting the president to two terms. Mr. Wade has said that his first term should not be counted because the law took effect after he had begun it.

The confrontation, at the site of the protests that ousted former President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali and kicked off the Arab Spring last year, was another manifestation of a role reversal now playing out across North Africa in the aftermath of the revolts in neighboring Egypt and Libya as well. In each, former exiles and political prisoners who spent careers under police state rule find themselves struggling to impose a new order on the bedlam left after the old regime's collapse.

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Demonstrations erupted across Syria on Friday, with some of the protesters' anger focused on United Nations observers, who have decided that they will not circulate on Fridays, the normal day for mass rallies that are suppressed by the government. Despite an ostensible cease-fire, violence flared across the country, with a roadside bomb killing 10 soldiers in the south, according to the state-run news, while YouTube videos posted from the devastated city of Homs showed flames and intense black smoke after government shelling of a downtown residential neighborhood. Col. Ahmed Himmiche, the Moroccan officer heading the advance team of United Nations observers in Syria, was quoted as telling reporters in Damascus that they would avoid Friday patrols, a statement that confirmed suspicions of many who have experienced the brunt of government oppression that the mission would be toothless. ''We don't want to be used as a tool for escalating the situation,'' he said.

Perhaps no other Formula One race has been as politically charged and controversial as the Bahrain Grand Prix that is to be run this weekend near Manama. More than a car race, the event has become a flash point in the battle between Bahrain's ruling royal family and anti-government opposition groups, with Formula One and the sport's governing body drawn in.

That is the only way to stop the killing in Syria and avoid another war.	The United Nations Security Council gave Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, a chance to end the killing and avoid complete chaos with a plan that called for a cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops from embattled cities and a political transition. It is deplorable -- but no surprise -- that he reneged on nearly every promise. On Friday, activists reported that Syrian troops fired tear gas and bullets on thousands of protesters. The government is thwarting U.N. cease-fire monitors by restricting their numbers and movement. The monitors got off to a bad start, sparking outrage from the opposition after they said they would not circulate on Friday, the normal day for mass rallies. And according to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the government is failing to provide needed food and medicine to 230,000 displaced people, and refusing to allow outside agencies to help.

If a sugar beet falls off a truck in a story by McGregor, it's safe to assume things won't go well for the car directly behind. In these 30 electric tales of menace, however, this wicked British writer is less interested in how things pan out than in capturing that awful moment when someone recognizes he is powerless to undo his fate. (For one luckless character, the real threat looms after she has survived a smashed windshield and been rescued by two seemingly model citizens.) This is a book of ominous preludes and chilling aftermaths: the incantatory account of a vacationer at a war-ravaged resort in the minutes before he drowns; the Pinteresque power play of a vicar's wife whose husband offers shelter to a gallingly manipulative stranger. McGregor stealthily commands our active engagement, scattering crumbs of data for us to pick through, gumshoe-style. The technique shrewdly exposes the disconnection of transgressive characters, like the miscreant father refused entry to his daughter's Nativity pageant, or the man who wreaks terrible vengeance on a noisy neighbor. The neighbor's punishment? McGregor puts faith in the cruelty of his readers' imaginations, leaving that to us.

MANAMA, Bahrain -- After a night of clashes between antigovernment demonstrators and the police, a protester was found dead Saturday near this capital, as Bahrain struggled to restore calm before an international auto race on Sunday. Opposition groups blamed the police for the death. Bahrain, a Sunni-ruled monarchy in the Persian Gulf, has beaten back persistent protests from the country's Shiite majority for more than a year. The protesters have intensified their actions in recent days, and clashed with the police again on Saturday, hoping to use the international attention focused on the country during the Formula One Grand Prix race to press their grievances.

When I was invited to visit Bahrain by members of the royal family, I hesitated. They had crushed peaceful protesters last year, and their police had used tear gas against human rights activists. Like everybody else, including some of the Bahraini policemen I later spoke with, I was appalled at the violence and thought the monarchy had blood on its hands. But I felt that declining the offer was irresponsible. I wanted to know the monarchy's side of the story. So I accepted the invitation -- on the condition that I was free to meet Bahrain's opposition. Bahrain is a tiny island nation of 600,000 citizens, with a Parliament of only 40 members, and it cannot be understood if looked at in isolation. For one thing, it stands at the forefront of a regional cold war. Saudi Arabia lies to the west, connected by a 25-kilometer causeway built jointly by the Saudis and Bahrainis. To the east, across the waters of the Gulf, lies Iran. Both Tehran and Riyadh have major stakes in Bahrain.

CAIRO -- As least 11 people were killed after assailants attacked protesters staging a sit-in near Egypt's Ministry of Defense early on Wednesday, setting off hours of clashes that threw the coming presidential election into disarray as at least five candidates announced the suspension of their campaigns to protest the deaths. The victims, killed by gunfire, clubs or knives, included a third-year medical student from Luxor and several young men from the Cairo neighborhood Abbaseya, where the fighting occurred, doctors said. It went for hours with no intervention from the authorities -- suggesting to some at least a degree of government complicity -- as opposing sides fought a pitched battle hurling stones and incendiary devices, turning a residential neighborhood into a war zone marked by scattered fires.

The latest bloodshed, which left at least two people dead and hundreds injured, started after thousands of protesters marched peacefully to the ministry, defying a warning by the ruling military council not to approach the building.

The documentary ''Under African Skies,'' which opens this week in New York and Los Angeles, will remind many people of what they love about ''Graceland,'' the Paul Simon album whose 25th anniversary the film celebrates. Seeing it will also be a jolt for those who have forgotten the world of bitterness into which it was born. Most of the film is music and motion and commotion: Ladysmith Black Mambazo high-stepping and smooth-crooning, the guitarist Ray Phiri doing his swivel-hip thing, drums and bass pulsing under Mr. Simon's rolling, tumbling New-York-surreal lyrics. People singing and swaying at huge open-air concerts in London and Lesotho. Others marching and getting beaten in Johannesburg. Penny whistles and accordions. Billy clubs and tear gas.

But they never left -- and now they offer an interesting view of the stirrings in Bahrain, which unlike any of the other Arab states affected by uprisings in the past year, has a majority population of expatriates.

MOSCOW -- The inauguration of Vladimir Putin as president for the third time had the air of a bad Russian hangover. On one side there was the tolling of the Kremlin bells, the parade, the gilded halls, the secret transfer of the nuclear suitcase, the blessing of the Patriarch, the ringing applause -- like a slap to the face -- of the courtiers, lackeys and international lobbyists; on the other side, a gloomy day after a ruthless, bloody fight. For the first time in perhaps all Russian history, the installation of the principal leader came the day after a brutal crackdown, as the police dispersed Putin's opponents. Only once before, in 1825, was there anything remotely similar, albeit on a far greater scale, when the revolutionary gentry arose in protest against the accession of Nicholas I.

WASHINGTON -- There have been many hundreds of varied rulings in the lower courts on when the use of Taser stun guns by the police amounts to excessive force, and sooner or later the Supreme Court will have to bring order to this area of the law. Next week, the justices are scheduled to decide whether to hear an appeal from three Seattle police officers who say they are worried about the future of what they call ''a useful pain technique.'' The case involves Malaika Brooks, who was seven months pregnant and driving her 11-year-old son to school in Seattle when she was pulled over for speeding. The police say she was going 32 miles per hour in a school zone; the speed limit was 20.

OTTAWA -- Quebec's government said Wednesday night that it would introduce emergency legislation that would suspend the academic year at many of the province's French-speaking universities and colleges in an attempt to end a 14-week student strike over a plan to increase tuition. Jean Charest, the province's premier, said the semester would resume on a modified schedule in August in academic departments and schools that have been shut down by strikers, so that students would be able to complete the current school year. Mr. Charest declined to comment on reports from many news media outlets in Quebec that the legislation would also impose significant fines on anyone who tried to block access to classrooms.

Sympathy protests for victims of the crackdown on the students were also reported in several other Syrian cities in what organizers called ''the heroes of Aleppo University'' demonstrations, and in some cases they were broken up by security forces using live ammunition.

The protest and the mayhem, conveyed by students who streamed live video to the Internet, was the first big demonstration at Aleppo University since security forces raided and emptied the dormitories two weeks ago in a crackdown that left at least four students dead. The university was then closed. It reopened Sunday.

Either way, it was too big for the limited seating at Demba Diop Stadium here -- a fact not lost on those who started lining up outside at 9 a.m., 10 hours before the main event. The marquee combatants arrived in the late afternoon, welcomed by musical odes and a chorus of erratic drumming. Each defied his massive frame, nimbly performing the ''dance of champions'' and taking measures to repel black magic before stepping into the ring. The preparations at the stadium for the fight last month lasted hours; the bout, mere minutes. For the wrestlers and their fans, however, the outcome would endure for years.

''5 Broken Cameras'' provides a grim reminder -- just in case you needed one -- of the bitter intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A chronicle of protest and endurance, punctuated by violence and tiny glimmers of hope, this documentary is unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again. For anyone who retains an interest in the human contours of the situation, however, the movie is necessary, if difficult, viewing. For while it is hardly neutral -- presenting an extended, highly personal view of life in a West Bank village adjacent to Israel's controversial security fence -- ''5 Broken Cameras'' is much more than yet another polemical bulletin from an embattled region. It may seem perverse to praise an eyewitness account of political trauma for its formal accomplishments, but for a project like this to claim the attention of an audience it has to justify itself as cinema. There is no shortage of information and opinion about the Middle East, and this film, made collaboratively by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi, is partly a piece of advocacy journalism. But it is also a visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art.

Mr. Hassanin, 18, ducked between parked cars, he later told prosecutors, but not fast enough. A bullet entered the back of his head, leaving his body permanently numb on one side and his speech only a barely intelligible, childlike moan.

Augusto Pinochet attended the screening of a pro-Pinochet documentary, reflecting the divisions that still exist in Chile almost 40 years after he seized power in a bloody coup. The police on Sunday sealed off the area around the Caupolicán Theater, where political rallies against General Pinochet were held during the years of his dictatorship. The demonstrators tried to block people from entering the theater, throwing eggs, spitting on them, and shouting ''assassins'' and ''fascists.''

But enmity between Russia and Poland runs centuries deep and a march by Russian fans in honor of their national holiday, Russia Day, brought out Polish fans and clashes erupted. Polish soccer hooligans chanted, ''Hit the red trash with a hammer, with a sickle'' and ''Instead of leaves, there'll be communists hanging from the trees.''

A teenager wrapped his scarf close to his mouth, bracing for tear gas. A man peeked out of his doorway, holding his infant daughter above his head, to show her a ritual of defiance that has become a grinding way of life. For months, the protests have aimed at the ruling monarchy, but recently they have focused on a new target. To their familiar slogans -- demanding freedoms, praising God and cursing the ruling family -- the young protesters added a new demand, written on a placard in English, so the Americans might see: ''U.S.A.

BONIYAR, India -- After decades of war, Kashmir is blooming again. Hotels are bursting, roads are being fixed and offices rebuilt. But with the guns silenced, India must soon decide whether justice will be as welcome as the tourists. Mass murderers walk the streets openly, having killed thousands of people who are buried in unmarked graves in scores of secret cemeteries. This beautiful village has one such graveyard. Nine years after Indian police officers and troops deposited hundreds of bullet-ridden corpses here as part of their campaign to suppress an independence movement supported by Pakistan, dirt mounds still rise above the shallow and unmarked plots as if the circumstances of the deaths left the earth above the bodies unsettled.

The police wounded a prominent human rights activist by shooting her in the leg with a tear-gas canister, witnesses said Thursday. The activist, Zainab al-Khawaja, was fired on at close range, said Yousef al-Muhafedha, a member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. The injury did not appear life-threatening. Ms. Khawaja is the daughter of the jailed activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, whose hunger strike of more than 100 days brought renewed international attention to the protest movement in Bahrain. Bahrain's majority Shiites, emboldened by Arab Spring protests elsewhere, began an uprising more than 16 months ago seeking to limit the wide-ranging powers of the ruling Sunni dynasty. At least 50 people have been killed in the unrest in Bahrain, which is home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet. Bahrain's monarchy has made concessions, but not enough to satisfy demands of the protesters.

The police in Shifang, an ancient city in Sichuan Province that suffered heavy damage during a 2008 earthquake, issued a warning on Tuesday that they would ''severely punish'' anyone involved in further protests. Yet postings on Chinese social media said that thousands gathered outside local government offices again on Tuesday night to demand the release of students detained in the previous day's protests; it was not immediately clear how the police would respond.

KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Antigovernment protesters in greater Khartoum and other Sudanese cities clashed with riot police officers on Friday after prayers in a third week of protest. ''Revolution is the choice of the people; Freedom, Peace and Justice!'' and ''The people want to bring down the regime!'' the protesters chanted as they left the Imam Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi Mosque in Omdurman, Khartoum's sister city across the Nile. But the crowd, of about 500 people, was driven back by tear gas while trying to move to a nearby field. Plainclothes security officers arrested some of them.

Antigovernment protesters in and around Khartoum, the capital, and in other cities clashed with riot police officers on Friday as demonstrations stretched into a third week. About 500 people leaving a mosque in the city of Omdurman were driven back by tear gas while trying to move to a nearby field. Security officers made some arrests. Activists called the day Vagabonds' Friday, a taunt directed at President Omar al-Bashir, who had described the protesters in a speech as ''agitators'' and ''vagabonds.'' While a spokesman for the Khartoum State Police, Al-Sir Ahmad Umar, denied that protests were widespread, activists reported demonstrations in several cities, including Kosti, Sinnar, New Halfa and Dongola. Austerity measures, including an end to fuel subsidies, prompted the recent wave of protests.

Some of the fiercest fighting that was reported took place in the Salaheddiin quarter of Aleppo, the first time that sustained street battles have erupted between the two sides so close to the center of the country's commercial hub, long a bastion of support for President Bashar al-Assad.

AMMAN, Jordan -- Fearing the fallout and the spread of the uprising in Syria, Jordanian officials have recently moved more forcefully to restrain opponents of the Syrian government who have fled to Jordan, activists here say. A Syrian opposition leader from Dara'a said that intelligence agents tried to dissuade him from returning after a recent trip outside the country. Jordanian airline officials demanded he buy a ticket to go on to Damascus before he boarded the plane. In another case, an artist once imprisoned in Syria said that since arriving in Jordan in March, he had been interrogated four times by intelligence agents who warned that he would be sent back to Syria if he engaged in conspicuous activism against the Syrian government.

Serving, I thought, was a way to help them.

But these days, its 1,300 inhabitants are less occupied with scratching coal from the earth than with combating government security forces as part of a struggle over the future of Spain's economy. In recent clashes, the miners blocked roads and railroad lines, used slings to hurl rocks at the police and fired golf balls from homemade bazookas. The police answered with tear gas and rubber bullets. Along the entrance to the village, rocks are still piled up in preparation for renewed battle.

MBABANE, Swaziland -- Every day, King Mswati III and his retinue of 13 wives face tough choices: Should they drive the BMW or the Rolls-Royce? Which plush palace to sleep in? Jet off to Dubai for a shopping spree or to Las Vegas to play the tables? Doris, a 35-year-old nurse who lives here in the capital of this tiny kingdom, Africa's last absolute monarchy, faces a rather different set of choices: Do her four children need new school uniforms, or can the holes in them be repaired for another semester? How much chicken should she put in each night's dinner, given that she can afford only one chicken a week on her take-home pay of about $300 a month?

The Anti-Capitalist Brigade started gathering early on May Day at Oakland's Snow Park. There was free coffee, oatmeal, doughnuts, fliers with the day's agenda and plenty of pot. A ''street medic'' -- ''I just finished a wilderness first-aid course,'' he told me when I asked about his training -- tended to his first case of the day, a man in his 20s whose leg had been beaten to a purple hue with a metal rod in an overnight fight in the park. Nearby, an organizer reminded protesters to take down the toll-free number for the National Lawyers Guild: ''This is important. Do not put it in your cellphones, because if you get arrested, the cops will take those away. Write it on your bodies. In indelible ink. There are Sharpies on the table.'' No central action was planned. A coalition of labor unions had asked Occupy Oakland, with its proven ability to turn out large numbers of militant activists, to blockade the Golden Gate Bridge, but then withdrew the request at the last minute. Instead, thousands of Occupy protesters met at various ''strike stations'' and fanned out into the streets with shields and gas masks (or the homemade alternative: bandannas soaked in vinegar), transforming downtown Oakland into a roving carnival of keyed-up militants of every shape and size: graduate students, tenured professors, professional revolutionaries, members of the Black Bloc, dressed like ninjas, their faces obscured.

Despite a pledge to stop abuses by its security forces, the ruling Sunni minority in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom of Bahrain is engaged in systematic and disproportionate use of tear gas on its restive Shiite majority, permitting police officers to routinely fire volleys at point-blank range at crowds and into homes and vehicles in Shiite neighborhoods, a leading rights group said in a report released on Wednesday. The group, the Physicians for Human Rights, which has been highly critical of the Bahraini monarchy's behavior since the Shiite protests inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings began there 18 months ago, called the policy on tear gas use unprecedented in the world, even among dictatorships where tear gas is a staple tool for crowd control.

The daughter of a prominent Bahraini opposition activist and 40 other people were arrested Friday, hours after security forces used tear gas and birdshot to disperse hundreds of protesters demanding political reforms, activists said. At least 45 people were injured when the security forces broke up three separate protests across Bahrain on Thursday, they said. Bahrain crushed an uprising led by majority Shiite Muslims last year, but protest marches and rallies continue. Shiites say they have long been marginalized in political and economic life, an accusation the government denies. Bahrain's Sunni rulers have rejected the main opposition demand: an elected parliament with full powers to pass laws and form governments. The head of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, Mohammed al-Maskati, said Zainab al-Khawaja was arrested Friday when she tried to hold a solitary sit-in near the capital, Manama. She is the daughter of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a leading Shiite figure in the uprising who ended a long hunger strike in May after drawing attention to the issue of imprisoned activists.

MARIKANA, South Africa -- The police fired on machete-wielding workers engaged in a wildcat strike at a platinum mine here on Thursday, leaving a field strewed with bodies and a deepening fault line between the governing African National Congress and a nation that, 18 years after the end of apartheid, is increasingly impatient with deep poverty, rampant unemployment and yawning inequality.In a scene replayed endlessly on television that reminded some South Africans of the days when the police of the apartheid government opened fire on protesters, heavily armed officers shot into a charging crowd of workers who walked off the job last Friday, demanding higher wages.

The large, lush reserve is known for its healthy population of jaguars, so, following closely behind our guide, we kept our eyes peeled for the elusive cats. We saw a few tracks and some claw marks on trees, but elected to leave the jungle before nightfall.
