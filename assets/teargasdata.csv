But with more than 80 people already driven from their homes by the situation and with many demanding that the state move immediately to drive the group out of its ramshackle citadel in the West Texas mountains, the state officials were clearly grappling with the questions of when or whether they should move to dislodge the militants, whose number the state estimated at 13 adults and no children."

The memories seem to arise from some eerie universe in which different laws are in effect. It somehow made sense to sit in the middle of a city street at 3 A.M. and block nonexistent traffic in an act of protest. It made sense to close down a major university and invite 13,000 protesters to eat granola and yogurt in the dining halls. It made sense for many to argue that armed revolution was imminent, that the Constitution was about to be suspended, that we were living in a country that had evolved from a Weimar-style republic into something unspeakable."

Cunanan, a 27-year-old man the authorities once labeled brazen, wily and highly intelligent, had holed up along the edge of the water for nine days, officials said, too frightened to cape. Rather than face an unscripted ending, he shot himself in the mouth with a .40 caliber gun."

But this week more than 450 farmers across Italy blocked roads with tractors to protest a Government plan to shift the cost to the farmers. ''This game of the milk fines has to be ended,'' said Vilmare Giacomazzi, an organizer of demonstrations held today in Rome. An invasion of Rome by thousands of tractors is planned for Sunday."

They are the first criminal charges filed against police and state government officials who have been under investigation for the massacre. Federal prosecutors indicated that their investigation was closing in on higher state officials who may have provided direct support to the killers. They said the police commander had testified that ''superior officers'' ordered him to turn a blind eye to paramilitary groups flaunting illegal weapons in his precinct as long as they were sympathizers of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI."

But its central allegation was largely based on a disputed interviewing technique involving recovered memories that the American Psychiatric Association has condemned. Recovered memories -- suppressed horrors dredged up under therapy -- drew attention a few years ago when they became the basis of a spate of charges of incest, satanic-ritual abuse and sexual abuse at child-care centers. They were discredited when investigators determined that many of them had been implanted by zealous therapists determined to find a cause for a patient's emotional distress."

By this morning, the demonstration had left a consulate in flames and the embassy here in a state of siege with most of its windows broken by rocks. In Chengdu, in western China, several thousand protesters threw rocks and bottle-rockets, setting a consulate building on fire. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, said an embassy spokesman here."

Long gone are the sights and sounds of my undergraduate days three decades ago -- windows shattering in the night, tear-gas canisters exploding, the president's office in flames. So it was with considerable curiosity that I returned to campus last weekend to attend a reunion of the anti-war movement that did so much to transform Stanford into a political battleground in the late 1960's. What, I wondered, had become of the students who spent their college years resisting the war in Vietnam and Stanford's links to it? What, if any, vestiges of the movement could be found on campus today?"

A1 Yugoslavia insisted that it play a central role in negotiations within the United Nations to end the war and provide a political settlement to Kosovo. A7 Rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence claim to have killed a Russian captain in a battle with Serbian troops inside Kosovo, in a development that could complicate Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis. A7 NATO warplanes assigned to attack a military compound in northwestern Kosovo struck what Yugoslavia's official news agency described as a nearby prison, killing at least 19 inmates and guards. A7 Smallpox Elimination Delayed A World Health Organization panel in Geneva effectively decided to postpone eradicating the world's known remaining stocks of the smallpox virus until at least 2002. The recommendation reflected widespread agreement that more time is needed to study smallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed. A3 Indonesian Students Protest Students protested and demanded that former President Suharto be tried on charges of corruption as they marched on Parliament on the first anniversary of Mr. Suharto's resignation. The police fired warning shots and tear gas at 2,000 protesters in a scene reminiscent of the riots that drove Mr. Suharto from office after 30 years. A3 New Bombing Suspect The United States Government has taken another suspect into custody in the continuing investigation of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa last year. The suspect, Ihab M. Ali, was charged with perjury on Wednesday after he came to New York City. A4 Germany's Immigration Law Germany adopted an immigration law that will make it easier for many of the country's seven million residents of foreign origin to become citizens. The legislation will go into effect on Jan. 1. A3 World Briefing A4 NATIONAL A8-11, 14 House Democrats Seek Early Vote on Gun Bill House Democrats called for a gun-control vote within the next week, in a move to build on the momentum of the Senate's juvenile crime bill that includes firearms measures. A1 A handful of provisions in the Senate bill may do as much or more to curb the flow of illegal guns than the much debated measures that require child safety locks and background checks at gun shows. A10 Today's graduation at Columbine High School will be broadcast by CNN. The community finds itself struggling with the massacre and with how to reclaim its privacy. A8 Investigators are planning to labor through the summer to determine if any friends of the gunmen in the Columbine school shootings aided them or knew of the attack beforehand. A8 The youth who shot and wounded six students at a school in Conyers, Ga., sat in a juvenile detention center for a second day as investigators continued to search his family's home for clues to his motivation. A8 Fund-Raiser Pleads Guilty Yah Lin Trie, a Democratic fund-raiser and friend of President Clinton, pleaded guilty to two political fund-raising charges and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry. A1 A note the Justice Department has obtained from Mr. Trie's Little Rock office suggests he was aware of a bribery problem. A9 Ruling on Medical Marijuana The Administration announced that it would sell Government-grown marijuana to privately financed scientists for research into whether marijuana can help sick people. A11 Reduced Penalty Sought Lawyers for President Clinton asserted in court that he should pay no more than $33,737 in reimbursements to lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Clinton. The Jones lawyers want $500,000. A14 Genome Project on Schedule The publicly financed effort to decode the human genome is on track to meet its goal of finishing a draft of the genome in a year. A11 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Plea Deal Rejected In Police Brutality Case Prosecutors have refused a plea deal sought by the police officer charged with torturing Abner Louima, according to people close to the case. They said that the offer was made and rejected the day after a police sergeant testified that the officer, Justin A. Volpe, had boasted to him that he had committed the torture. A1 Clintons Eye New York Vacation Hillary Rodham Clinton is edging closer to running for the Senate from New York, and the Clintons' choice of summer vacation spot is once again affected by politics. The First Couple are exploring the recreational options across the Empire State. A1 Lucci Wins an Emmy Susan Lucci won the Daytime Emmy award for best actress. The hard-luck soap star, who had been nominated 18 times, was honored for her portrayal of Erica Kane on ''All My Children.'' B4 Religious Rights Violated A Westchester County school district violated its students' First Amendment rights to religious freedom by allowing schools to engage in religious-oriented activities, including the construction of a Hindu god's likeness and New Age prayer recitals at an Earth Day celebration, a Federal judge ruled. B1 Plan to Block Pay Fails A law withholding legislators' pay until a budget is passed is unconstitutional, a Brooklyn judge ruled. The ruling was a blow to an attempt to speed the state's notoriously lethargic budget process.

Of course, a chronology that TNT has sent out with publicity releases about the film notes that Mr. Job and Mr. Wozniak didn't meet until 1973, when they were both employees of Hewlett-Packard. But then the film doesn't claim to be a documentary -- or even a docudrama. In it, the real-life events and real characters involved in the early days of the computer age are given the star treatment (as heroes or villains, depending on your perspective). The script also goes beyond the office wars and gets personal about its subjects."

It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and flow stations, where about two million barrels of crude are collected each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad. Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta, and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area. The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky, clearly shouting and shaking their fists.

Since then at least 3,200 people, many of whom were simply caught in the crossfire, have been killed. In ''The Freedom of the City,'' whose evocative revival is being presented as part of Lincoln Center Festival '99, the Irish playwright Brian Friel tells the fictional story of three of them. The conflict known as ''the Troubles'' has provided at least a subtext for much of Irish literature, especially that written for the stage, over the last three decades. In Mr. Friel's ''Aristocrats,'' which is also being staged by the Gate Theater during the festival, and in ''Translations,'' the plight of a people at the mercy of powers beyond their control runs between the lines. But in ''The Freedom of the City,'' which concerns three ordinary protest marchers who accidentally occupy Derry's Guildhall and end up being gunned down as ''terrorists,'' Mr. Friel openly addresses the strife that at the time of its writing had just come to full boil."

Now, thousands of students and other protesters in Teheran and other cities have taken to the streets to challenge the power of the fundamentalist ayatollahs. They have been greeted by violent repression. The clerics who control the security forces are in danger of misreading their nation as badly as the Shah did two decades ago if they think they can prevent change with tear gas, bullets and vigilantes. The student protesters are invoking the more democratic and liberal values espoused by President Mohammad Khatami and backed by a substantial majority of Iranians, particularly young people and women. In the long run, these more humane values are likely to prevail. Nearly two-thirds of Iranians are now under the age of 25. But the immediate course of events will depend on whether the clerical authorities led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei understand that they must relax their stranglehold on Iranian society."

Ms. Reno, who is said to have decided yesterday to mount an independent inquiry, should seek out and appoint qualified investigators as soon as possible."

That the protests were aimed not at a divisive war but a peaceable meeting of the World Trade Organization made the whole thing even more surreal. The chaos conveyed a warning to both sides. The violence and property destruction diverted attention from the basic point the demonstrators sought to make -- the need to reform the W.T.O.'s procedures and values. Protest leaders were right to condemn the lawlessness quickly. But the W.T.O.'s 135 members will make a huge mistake if they fail to grasp the core belief fueling these unruly protests -- that the W.T.O. is far too insular, that it has displayed too little sensitivity for issues like workers' rights and the environment, and that its secretive procedures undermine public trust. It is possible to agree with the W.T.O.'s goal of free trade, as this page does, and also to agree with President Clinton that the protesters' causes merit sympathy."

So it was a shock to see the host city of the World Trade Organization meeting face down protesters with tear gas, rubber pellets and the National Guard this week. The root problem seems to be a failure by Seattle's mayor and police chief to prepare for the size of the demonstrations and possible violence. The mayor's instincts were commendable -- to give demonstrators who had come from around the country the opportunity to protest peacefully in the center of the city. He has argued that a big show of police force would have unfairly squelched free speech and possibly incited the crowd. At first his approach seemed to be working. An orderly, festive parade of more than 30,000 labor and environmentalist demonstrators did march through the heart of the city to the sound of brass bands."

The problem? The trap door's security system was so elaborate that in the heat of the moment no one in the car could figure out how to get it open. According to a report in The New York Post, one witness told the grand jury that Combs yelled: ''Trap! Trap! Open the trap!'' (Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of illegal gun possession.) Police say that secret gun vaults are increasingly common among certain high-risk drivers. And for those who have enough money and know the right auto-body mechanic, they are just one of the many options available. Trap Doors First used by drug gangs, these discreet compartments can keep illegal contraband (or legitimate cargo, should the need arise) safe and out of sight. As long as you can open them, that is: law-enforcement officials in New York have discovered traps -- inside dashboards, behind back seats, in door panels and floorboards -- that pop open only when the operator turns on the heat while the radio is set to a certain station, or when he inserts a hairpin into connections in the doorjamb while stepping on the brakes. More high-tech versions involve a series of microswitches that must be flipped in sequence. A few years ago, a drug gang in Washington Heights had a whole fleet of nondescript sedans whose traps could be opened only by inserting fuses into the second and fourth slots on the right column of the fuse box and then activating the rear-window defroster. ''Five years ago,'' one veteran New York City lawman said, ''these things were unusual. Now they're commonplace.'' Then again, he added, ''to some degree that's a function that we know to look for them now.'' Trap doors aren't actually illegal. Still, many alarm shops or auto detailers are leery of installing them. ''The police department frowns upon that kind of stuff,'' said the owner of a custom shop in the Bronx. ''If you start putting it in they give you a hard time. People ask me for safes, and I won't do it, because it's just too much to have in my head.'' Michael Trusio, a senior sales executive at Krystal Enterprises in Brea, Calif., agrees that it's business he'd rather not have. But, he added, ''we don't want to tell somebody no and then have someone come around and burn our plant down.'' Armor Car armor, which can include bulletproof glass in the windows, ballistic steel in the doors and body and Kevlar shields for the floorboards and gas tank, was once used for skittish billionaires and presidential motorcades. Today, it's just another accessory for the nation's wealthiest drivers. But all that security doesn't come cheap. Outfitting the family Mercedes in this bulletproof material can cost $100,000. And for some, that's just the beginning. ''I can think of 10 or 12 families who have armored cars for everyone,'' said Craig Fingold, the president of Beverly Hills Motoring, which has dubbed itself the Neiman Marcus of automotive accessories. Depending on the thickness, armor can add from 400 to 4,000 pounds to the weight of the car. Fingold said that a record mogul who had been threatened with death by a rapper had recently come in and had his Suburban outfitted with 4-inch metal -- enough to stop machine-gun fire. And Notorious B.I.G. stopped in to check out an armoring system but did not buy it. A few months later, he was shot to death in his Suburban. The Works Even drivers whose security concerns don't involve wielding or dodging heavy firepower have a number of self-defense toys to consider. Auto Taser ($200) delivers a powerful electric shock to anyone who lays an unwelcome hand on the steering wheel. Tiny video cameras ($800) that are installed with a clear view of the front seat can be useful for those who want evidence of police harassment; Fingold says they're especially popular with celebrities and sports figures. But for some wary drivers, the best defense is a good offense. Outfits like the Counter Spy Shops sell devices that spew oil, leaving a dangerous slick behind them ($1,300); they are reportedly popular in Russia, as are similar devices that spray a mist of oil on the windshield of the car behind ($1,300). Contraptions that scatter a large number of tacks in a car's wake -- first seen on countless Saturday-morning cartoons -- cost slightly more. (They start at $1,500.) Counter Spy claims it installed one for the Shah of Iran. Thankfully for the average American driver, however, most are available for export only. Finally, for those less afraid of fellow motorists than of airborne hazards, the smart choice is a tear-gas deterrent system that seals the car against unfiltered air ($5,000)."

Hundreds of Lebanese students joined with other protesters in throwing rocks and tomatoes at Lebanese army and police detachments, which responded with batons, tear gas canisters and high-pressure water hoses. The protests appeared to have been organized with the help of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Party of God, whose guerrillas have mounted an offensive in southern Lebanon that has killed seven Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks. In a fiery speech on Wednesday, the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, citing official American statements that supported the Israeli bombing, called on this nation of 3.5 million people to boycott the United States ambassador, David Satterfield, whom he described as ''the U.S.-Israeli ambassador in Lebanon.''"

Some critics take it further and say all hazing must stop. The recent acts are criminal and should be prosecuted. But the very pervasiveness of hazing should also alert people that something else is going on. Unlike most violence, hazings are, to some degree, elective, and they result in an increase in status on the part of the victim.

Through the years, Israel has been consistently criticized by many human and civil rights organizations for invoking national security to explain practices that were considered exclusionary, discriminatory and coercive toward Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. But since the right-wing government was replaced last summer by a broad coalition including several leftists and human rights advocates, crucial policy changes have been made that, together with a spate of High Court decisions, point toward a sea change."

A4 Bosnia votes in municipal elections today to decide whether to stay with ethnic parties that led them to war eight years ago. A4 New Japan Leader's Promise Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, in his first policy speech to Parliament, vowed to continue and expand the economic and other changes begun by his ailing predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, who remained in a coma. A5 I.M.F.'s New Chief in Russia Stanley Fischer said the fund was ready to pursue a new relationship with Russia as soon as President-elect Vladimir V. Putin acted on his promise to build a better foundation for the country's still shaky market economy. Mr. Fischer, the fund's acting director, met with Mr. Putin before making his remarks. A6 American Not Charged The United States said Russia had not formally charged an American arrested on suspicion of spying. The United States Embassy identified the American as Edmond Pope, 53, and said he had been visited by a consular officer. A6 Haiti Election Protest Two top officials have resigned at the urging of the center-left opposition coalition to protest the government's failure to schedule local and parliamentary elections. Environment Minister Yves Cadet and Jean Ronald Joseph, labor undersecretary at the Social Affairs Ministry, held their posts since March 1999. (AP) Bolivians Protest Water Rates The police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons to scatter crowds in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third-largest city, during protests against an increase in water rates. Chaos enveloped some streets of the city, which is 350 miles east of La Paz, as protesters threw rocks and firebombs at the police, who then stormed the rioters. Hundreds of police officers and soldiers have virtually taken control of the streets. (AP) World Briefing A6 NATIONAL A7-10, 14 Senate Adopts G.O.P. Plan For $1.8 Trillion Budget The Senate, voting 51 to 45 largely along party lines, approved a budget plan for next year that would raise spending on the military and education, cut or freeze spending in many domestic programs, reduce taxes by at least $150 billion over five years, add a $40 billion prescription drug benefit to Medicare and pay down publicly held debt with the surplus generated by Social Security. A1 Medicaid Rolls to Be Restored The Clinton administration ordered states to restore benefits to families improperly deprived of health insurance when they were left off the welfare rolls as an unintended consequence of the 1996 welfare law. A10 An Accuser Is Accused The Pentagon's inspector general opened a preliminary investigation of the Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, who has accused another general of sexual misconduct in 1996, senior defense officials said. The inquiry began after the Pentagon's inspector general received an electronic message from a retired officer who accused General Kennedy of personal misconduct during the mid-1980's. A9 U.S. to Let Elian Return Attorney General Janet Reno said government lawyers would prepare an order as early as next week allowing Elian Gonzalez to return to Cuba with his father. She appealed to the boy's Miami relatives to promptly and peacefully turn him over. A1 Vice President Al Gore made a campaign swing through Florida but avoided discussion of the Gonzalez case, even though it has dominated media coverage there for weeks. A8 Meeting With Gay Republicans Gov. George W. Bush said he had invited a small group of gay Republicans to meet with him next week, a development that stood in contrast to his longstanding refusal to meet formally with the Log Cabin Republicans, a leading gay political organization. A9 Finding Against Big Tobacco A Miami jury found that the diseases of three smokers chosen to represent hundreds of thousands of Florida residents in a class-action lawsuit had been caused by cigarettes, setting the stage for a potentially huge blow to the tobacco industry. A7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Ad Asked Welfare Workers To Fill In for Strikers The city distributed a flier offering welfare recipients who work for their benefits security jobs at residential buildings if doormen and other building workers went on strike. A Human Resources Administration official said the city had turned down a request to supply such workers, because it amounted to strike breaking, and she expressed puzzlement at the flier's distribution. B1 Operation Condor Cut Back A third of the overtime money earmarked for the ambitious but much-criticized anti-narcotics effort will instead be used for increased uniformed patrols that will pursue various other offenses, officials said. B1 No Plans to Change Mayor Giuliani said he would not alter his campaign style despite polls suggesting his candidacy was in difficulty, saying voters would ultimately judge him on his mayoral record. B4 Shake-Up at Jewish Weekly Seth Lipsky, founding editor of The Forward, is being forced out by owners who regard him as too right-wing for the paper's socialist traditions, editors and executives said. B3 Religion Journal B6 EDUCATION Merit Seen in Web Proposal The chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents, Carl T. Hayden, said a proposal to create a New York City Board of Education site on the Internet that accepts corporate advertising in exchange for computer equipment and services deserved serious consideration. B3 SPORTS D1-8 Duval Moves Up in Masters David Duval shot a seven-under-par 65 that gave him a one-stroke lead after the second round. D1 U.S. Stays Even in Davis Cup Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic swept Pete Sampras, 7-6 (1), 6-3, 6-2, but Andre Agassi evened the quarterfinal match at 1-1 by beating Slava Dosedel, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. D1 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 Demands for Perquisites Met Salomon Smith Barney, responding to demands compiled by a 23-year-old junior investment banker, is piling on perks to stem a flow of young employees to Internet companies.

The boosters' idea of using the summit to show off their city as a world-class friend to free trade didn't exactly pan out, amid all the demonstrations and the tear gas, but many residents think that the raucous protests against globalization amounted to a badge of honor for Seattle. Now the long-running tension here, between those who revel in the high-tech, high-wealth place Seattle has become and those who fret that the city is losing its quirky small-town charm, has a new focus: next month, a museum designed by Frank Gehry, known as the Experience Music Project, opens at the base of the Space Needle. Wildly curvy and colorful, built roughly in the shape of a guitar with the Seattle Center's monorail running through it, the museum is a celebration of modern music and includes a sound lab that, the museum says, lets you ''plug in, jam, dance, wail, scratch, learn, connect and, ultimately, experience the euphoria of making music.'' Some consider the building a brilliant addition to the architectural scene; some call it a curse on the civic landscape. Come and judge for yourself."

The case file is about as thick as 25 metropolitan phone books, a tower of motions and countermotions once regarded as a monument to futility by those who doubted that the case would ever reach trial. But six years after the lawsuit was filed, the trial is scheduled to open on Monday in Federal District Court in Waco, Tex. Once criticized as a bundle of anti-government conspiracies, the lawsuit is now being taken very seriously. At its core lies the fundamental question of whether the government was negligent in the deaths of more than 80 Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993, when the sect's Mount Carmel compound near Waco burned to the ground."

But Yevgeny Khaldei's Reichstag photograph was a perfect representation of victory in a bloody war, whereas the iconic images of the end of Mr. Milosevic's 13-year rule seem to offer a partial truth. Without the critical injection of force at a pivotal moment -- the hard men from central Serbia storming past the hesitant police and their tear gas -- the opposition's protests might have proved as ineffectual as they so often had in the past.

There is a long, wide street. The Israeli soldiers are on our end hiding behind three armored cars, popping out to fire tear gas, rubber bullets and real bullets at the Palestinian youths, who are pelting the soldiers with rocks and marbles from behind a pile of burned-out cars. Behind the Palestinians, five Palestinian ambulances are parked. When a Palestinian youth goes down, an ambulance races out, siren screaming, and the wounded boy is bundled off to the hospital, like a Roman gladiator scraped up off the ring.

On Saturday, two Serbs died and one was wounded in a melee with peacekeepers in the town of Leposavic. Today, gunmen fired on a joint American-Russian patrol as it tried to seal the boundary between Kosovo and part of southern Serbia where Albanian rebels have been challenging Yugoslav forces, the United States Army said. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is the dominant republic remaining in Yugoslavia."

The court issued a per curiam or unsigned decision in the case of Albert Gore Jr. and Joseph I. Lieberman v. Katherine Harris as Secretary of State. Justices Leander B. Shaw, Harry Lee Anstead, R. Fred Lewis, Barbara J. Pariente and Peggy A. Quince concurred, with Justices Shaw and Pariente filing separate opinions. Justice Major B. Harding and Chief Justice Charles T. Wells concurred in result only, with the chief justice filing a separate one-sentence opinion. FROM THE OPINION This case is before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court. In our previous opinion, we ordered the Circuit Court of Leon County to tabulate by hand 9,000 contested Dade County ballots. This court further held that relief would require manual recounts in all Florida counties where undervotes existed which had not previously been subject to manual tabulation."

This was the first time he had ever complained of a health problem in school, so his science teacher wrote him a permission slip to visit a nearby clinic. Ahmed shouldered his plaid-patterned book bag and walked out of the Rimal Boys' School and onto the chaotic streets of Beach Camp, where 75,000 Palestinian refugees are corralled into a half-square-mile block, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. It was Nov. 1 of this year. The previous day, Ahmed had sold his pet nightingale for a few shekels, and now, carrying this money, he caught a taxi and asked to be driven to a place called Karni crossing. He was wearing the nicest shirt he owned, a light blue button-down, and a few dabs of his father's cologne. On the outside of his book bag, in blue ink, he had inscribed a four-word epitaph: ''The Martyr Ahmed Abutayeh.'' Karni crossing, as its name implies, is an intersection. It's where the Karni Road crosses the so-called Green Line, the razor-wire border dividing the occupied territory of Gaza from Israel proper. The Gaza Strip is a place small enough to be easily fenced. It pokes from the northern end of the Egypt-Israel border and follows the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea; its silhouette is roughly that of a pistol, aimed just west of Jerusalem. Karni crossing is at a point about midway along the pistol's barrel."

In 1972, I was a junior TV journalist assigned to watch events in Northern Ireland, which that weekend happened to include a protest march in Derry. At most, I figured there would be the customary low-level standoff between protesters and the army, some stone-throwing and tear gas.

My nationalist sources and the police had forecast no real trouble, so I told my bosses at the London network that I would not need a film crew.

By June, many of the people filling the square and surrounding streets were spectators with only the vaguest political motives. It was into these crowds that the People's Liberation Army opened fire in the early hours of June 4, killing hundreds or even thousands of civilians. No one outside the inner councils of the Chinese government knows for certain how many people died or why. The recently published ''Tiananmen Papers,'' transcripts of government documents reportedly smuggled out of the country by a disaffected Chinese official, claim to tell what happened behind the high red walls of China's leadership compound in the weeks before the massacre.

Their agenda is much the same as the ill-fated ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, when attempts to bridge the gap between poor and wealthy countries' priorities blew up in a cloud of tear gas. The whole world has an interest in seeing this gathering turn out better. With the world's terrorized economy stuck at a standstill, the time is ripe for a cooperative, international push for growth through trade. The ministers' goal in Qatar is to launch a new set of comprehensive trade negotiations. During the original Uruguay Round, which led to the creation of the W.T.O., rich countries pledged to open their markets to textiles, crops and other basic exports from the developing world. There has been some progress in that area, but arcane customs rules, unnecessary red tape, stingy quotas and anti-dumping programs still keep poor nations' exports out of wealthy markets. Now protectionist politicians are trying to erect more barriers by exploiting concerns about border security and food safety."

For many of them, the remaining hours offered the slimmest hope that their loved ones survived the fireworks explosions that sent fireballs racing through the narrow streets of the district on Saturday night, setting four blocks ablaze and killing nearly 300 people. Wilfredo Palomino spent the morning holding a fruitless vigil outside the morgue, where the line of relatives snaked down the busy block and onto the lawn. His wife, Rosa, had taken a job selling fireworks with one of the many street vendors in Mesa Redonda only last Friday, after he lost his tailor's job on Christmas Eve.

At the same time, it keeps laying claim to art's special powers and perks. One of its traditional selling points is objectivity. Yet it's a medium of calculation: of measured light and chosen angles, of zooming in and editing out. These opposites define its tensions. Such tensions can be felt even in an exhibition as anti-elitist and programmatically didactic as ''Hidden Truths: Bloody Sunday 1972'' at the International Center of Photography. The show doesn't pretend for an instant to be art. Most of its dozens of pictures are digital scans of umpteenth generation press prints, images made to be transferred to newsprint and valued for information, not formal finesse."

For more than two decades Mr. Nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war, famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating, eloquent clarity. He was in Nicaragua at the height of the contra war, in South Africa during the bloody mid-1980's and in Rwanda in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. Mr. Frei shows video clips from those places, and many of Mr. Nachtwey's memorable pictures, some of which are all the more haunting for suggesting, rather than showing, the extent of the cruelty and suffering he has seen. The most terrible image from Rwanda may be one in which neither killers nor victims appear, but one whose frame is filled by a pile of machetes. The film is less a retrospective than a profile of the photographer in action. It begins in the eerie silence of Kosovo in 1999 with Mr. Natchtwey turning his camera on burning farmhouses, grieving families and grave sites and follows him into the poorest sections of Jakarta, where homeless families live beside railroad tracks, and to the West Bank city of Ramallah in the early months of the current intifada."

The public has grown increasingly impatient with the long-running and crippling economic crisis that is threatening President Eduardo Duhalde, whose Peronist party is allied with the groups that organized the protests. Mr. Duhalde came to power in January after riots in December that killed 27 people and brought down the government of Fernando de la Rúa. When appointed, Mr. Duhalde became Argentina's fifth president in less than two weeks."

The mounting number of dead, from among more than 750 hostages, cast a deep shadow over a predawn raid that the authorities had at first hailed as a successful operation. Also darkening the mood were disclosures that doctors were almost completely unprepared to treat the hostages for gas-related problems."

The powerful gas, which was pumped in through the theater's ventilation system, killed at least 116 of the hostages and sent hundreds more to the hospital. Whether the high death toll was deemed acceptable collateral damage or was the result of a terrible miscalculation is not known. Russia needs to provide fuller details on the assault and its harm to the hostages. Such information could help this country and others prepare to deal with future terrorist takeovers. The agent used against the Chechen terrorists was most likely an aerosol version of a potent, fast-acting opiate called Fentanyl that is used as an anesthetic for horses. Whatever the specific chemical, it falls into the category of incapacitating agents, which are supposed to be nonlethal."

''I saw your son the other day on television,'' he says. ''He was very good -- very interesting.'' He's not referring to Zacarias, who is being held in isolation in Virginia, charged with conspiracy in the Sept. 11 attacks. The waiter is talking about her other son, Abd-Samad Moussaoui, author of ''Zacarias, My Brother: The Making of a Terrorist,'' an account of his younger brother's life until 1995, when Zacarias was 27, after which the two fell permanently out of touch. Neither Abd-Samad nor the boys' mother knew what had become of Zacarias until Sept. 12, 2001, when the television news started flashing a mug shot of the man thought to be the ''20th hijacker.'' His head was shaved, and his face had gotten beefier, but the Moussaoui family knew it was Zacarias. ''You think it was very interesting?'' el-Wafi says with an engaging smile. Dressed in a camel's hair coat and leopard-print scarf, she shifts her weight to a more comfortable stance; she might be there awhile. Her tone shifts as well, taking on an edge. ''You think it was very impressive? You think it was 'très bien'? Let me ask you something: Is that what you would do if your brother was in jail?

The Israeli...","An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said. The Israeli military said the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the woman, and called it a ''very regrettable accident.'' The woman, Rachel Corrie, 23, from Olympia, Wash., was among eight Americans and Britons who had been acting has ''human shields'' to try to stop the almost daily house demolitions by Israeli forces in Rafah, a town on Gaza's border with Egypt. When the bulldozer approached a house today, Ms. Corrie, who was wearing a bright orange jacket, dropped to her knees, a practice that members of the group to which she belonged, the International Solidarity Movement, have used repeatedly, her colleagues at the scene said. As the bulldozer reached her without slowing up, she began to rise, but was trapped beneath a pile of dirt generated by its blade and the blade itself, said one member of the group, Tom Dale, who said he was standing about 30 feet away. ''We were shouting and waving our arms at the driver,'' said Mr. Dale, who is British. ''We even had a megaphone. But the bulldozer kept going until she was under the body or the tracks of the bulldozer.'' The bulldozer stopped for a few seconds and pulled back, Mr. Dale added. Her colleagues rushed to Ms. Corrie, who was bleeding from the head and face and badly wounded, but still breathing. An ambulance took her to Najar Hospital, where she died. She had a fractured skull and other injuries, said Dr. Ali Moussa, a hospital administrator. At the time Ms. Corrie was run over, she was in an open area in front of the house, Mr. Dale said. The bulldozer came from some distance away, and ''there was nothing to obscure the driver's view,'' he said. But Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman, said that the armored bulldozer had small windows and limited visibility, and that the driver had not been aware that Ms. Corrie was in his path. In a statement, the Israeli military said soldiers ''were dealing with a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger -- the Palestinians, themselves and our forces -- by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone.'' About an hour before Ms. Corrie was killed, troops fired tear gas and shot into the air during a confrontation with the protesters at a nearby house, both Mr. Dale and the Israeli military said. The International Solidarity Movement is made up mostly of Americans and Europeans in their 20's and 30's who are sympathetic to the Palestinians and oppose the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They have repeatedly placed themselves in front of Israeli forces operating in those areas. Last May, several members dashed past Israeli troops into the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Palestinian gunmen had been holed up for more than a month. The protesters remained for several days, until the standoff ended with the surrender of the gunmen. Ms. Corrie, who was to graduate from the Evergreen State College in Olympia this year, had been in Rafah for two months, living with Palestinians in areas where homes were being demolished, her colleagues said. In Olympia, Colin Reese, a student at Evergreen State and a close friend of Ms. Corrie, said she had focused much of her studies on community organizing. Describing her work in Gaza, he said, ''She was particularly touched by the Palestinian situation and wanted to use her privilege as an American citizen to help defend against the Israeli occupation.'' One of Ms. Corrie's teachers at Evergreen was Larry Mosqueda, a professor of political economy and social change, who said her work in Gaza was a reflection of lessons taught at Evergreen that encourage students to put their education to practical use while still in college. ''She has a strong sense of social justice,'' he said. ''Basically, she wanted to do something about it instead of just talk about it.'' In an e-mail message this month, Ms. Corrie described a Feb. 14 standoff in which members of her group ''stood in the path of the bulldozers and were physically pushed with the shovel backwards, taking shelter in a house.'' She added that ''the bulldozer then proceeded on its course, demolishing one side of the house'' with the protesters still inside. The Israeli Army and Palestinian militants wage frequent gun battles in Rafah. An unarmed Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli fire today in the town, said Palestinian security sources and hospital officials. The Israeli Army said it was checking the report. The military has flattened dozens of homes in Rafah, some because militants were using them for cover. The Israeli authorities have said the International Solidarity Movement's protesters prevent soldiers from acting against militants, and they have deported some members. Demonstrators have been hurt on a number of occasions, but Ms. Corrie was the first one killed.

Pelecanos's proletarian crime novels all work hard for a living, but none of the honest entrepreneurs in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington run their operations with the ruthless efficiency of the gun merchants and drug dealers in SOUL CIRCUS (Little, Brown, $24.95). With the territorial gang lord Granville Oliver out of commission and on trial for his life, business ethics dictate that two rival gangs should beef up their arsenals and fight it out for his drug trade. To the despair of Derek Strange, Pelecanos's salt-of-the-earth private investigator, more children are recruited for the gang war, and the only person who really benefits is Ulysses Foreman, the local gun dealer and an expert in supply and demand. ''Long as kids down here had no fathers and were looking to belong to something,'' Foreman says, ''then there was gonna be gangs and a need for guns.'' Pelecanos is fascinated with the way things work, and he takes apart the gun trade like an urban anthropologist, fitting the pieces into the drug business and the gang culture with an exactness that is breathtaking -- and depressing. At the same time, he treats his criminals like human beings, talking their talk, driving their cars, listening to their music, getting into their world with something that can only be called sympathy."

That was the year Tom Wolfe's ''Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers'' appeared. His account of media-savvy young African-Americans wearing berets and shades and hustling a scam, and of rich white types (Leonard Bernstein, Carter Burden) tripping all over themselves in support, was the Panther story people had been waiting for: a Rowan and Martin ''Laugh-In'' skit. A spoof, a circus, a farce. Mortified, the haute bourgeois Left turned off its largesse. The Panthers dropped in status from superstars to superfluous. ''Delicious,'' purred The Wall Street Journal of Mr. Wolfe's caustic little neo-conservative classic. The mainstream press did nothing to help Black Panther Party credibility. The party's membership, and its neighborhood-based food and medical programs, grew. So did F.B.I. surveillance and infiltration. (J. Edgar Hoover called the Panthers ''the greatest threat to the internal security of the United States.'')"

But they found more than 100 bullet holes on seven buildings across the street. The evidence, the report said, was inconsistent with American statements that the soldiers responded with ''precision fire'' when they were allegedly attacked."

It is midnight, and patrol cars cordon off the streets of run-down delis and dollar stores. Dozens of black-clad officers maneuver and bullhorn in the distance, practicing their tactics. ''We're expecting about 70,000 to 100,000 protesters to come down here in November,'' says a beat cop, guarding a corner from his squad car. ''Our guys are doing exercises all around.'' A few blocks over, at a red light, Lisa Fithian pulls her compact rental car behind a squadron of city police cruisers. Hers is one of the few civilian cars in this area, certainly the only one carrying an advance guard of that human wave heading for Miami. While most people have been ushered out of the downtown area, the 42-year-old Fithian wants to go into it, to do reconnaissance with three fellow activists. Weeks from now, she will be marching in these streets, and the police will no longer be practicing. Since it is difficult to find our way about, Fithian decides, boldly, to follow the cruisers. ''You know,'' she says, ''it's kind of nice to tail the cops for once.''"

Bush's handlers had him dress up as the 1986 Tom Cruise of ''Top Gun'' to dance a victory jig on an aircraft carrier, they didn't stop to think that he might soon face an opponent who could be type-cast more persuasively in his own Tom Cruise role. John F. Kerry was in real life a comrade of Ron Kovic, whom Mr. Cruise played to great acclaim in the 1989 ''Born on the Fourth of July.'' Mr. Kerry, like the movie's hero, was a decorated Vietnam soldier who became a star activist for Vietnam Veterans Against the War upon returning home. In a pivotal scene in the film, delegates at the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach eject Kovic and his fellow protesting vets from the hall, call him a traitor and spit on him. If that incident has a certain angry passion, it may be because the director was Oliver Stone. Like both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry, Mr. Stone was a son of privilege who attended Yale in the mid-1960's. Like Mr. Kerry but unlike Mr. Bush, he went on to combat in Vietnam, won a bronze star and then turned against America's most disastrous foreign war."

Everyone has seen how the population of Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, welcomed as liberators a motley group of rebels who now vow to march here to the capital. But that's only the most obvious sign of a resentment against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that has been growing for years. The most popular song of the Carnival that just ended, for example, was an attack on a government official, ''Madan Gougou,'' and by extension, on Mr. Aristide's Lavalas party. Schoolchildren pass around unflattering caricatures of the president, and anti-Aristide graffiti have proliferated in the streets. That's why Haitians weren't surprised when the democratic opposition, with no ties to the rebels, this week rejected an American-drafted proposal that would give it more power but also let President Aristide complete his term in office.

At a photographic institute in Tel Aviv, the soldiers, all recently discharged, offer video testimony of gratuitous harassment and abuse of Palestinians, like firing tear gas just to get a reaction. Hanging on the wall are dozens of car keys confiscated from Hebron residents, a punishment both common and unauthorized, soldiers say. And a photo taken by a soldier shows graffiti, presumably written by civilians, which reads, ''Arabs to the gas chambers.''"

The live-action video opened on a vista reminiscent of Iraq or Afghanistan. Scattered amid the scrub of a desert plain, angry demonstrators howl unintelligible slogans and advance menacingly on a handful of soldiers who nervously pivot their rifles back and forth trying to deter the mob. For safety's sake during this test run, the ''crowd'' -- played for the most part by off-duty soldiers -- flings bright green tennis balls at the uniformed servicemen instead of rocks. As one member of the crowd hurls a ball, a soldier operating the Active Denial System (it looks like a squat satellite dish) targets an unruly protester in the weapon's viewfinder, squeezes a trigger that releases a beam of energy and, in a split second, one ''civilian'' howls and scampers away, fanning his rear end. Other demonstrators suffer similar fates, yelping and fleeing in panic, as if they have encountered a wall of invisible fire. After tumbling backward, the horde spins around, pointing and hollering like a Stone Age tribe encountering modern weaponry for the first time. What they were feeling was a blast of electromagnetic energy that causes a great deal of pain but does no lasting harm. That, in essence, is the point of a new generation of nonlethal weapons being developed by the military: to enforce and do battle without killing, or in the words of the Defense Department, ''to incapacitate personnel or matériel, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel and undesired damage to property and the environment.'' Along with the Active Denial System, the military is testing bullets that disintegrate in mid-air, propelling their nonlethal payload to their targets, slimy goo that stops people in their tracks and, eventually, guns that shoot pulses of plasma energy that stun and disorient."

And the first half hour of ''Stander,'' which tells the true story of Andre Stander (Tom Jane), the notorious Johannesburg police captain who turned against a system he found repugnant, plays like a smoothly executed if predictable drama of one man's heroic rebellion. But just when you begin to relax and wait for the usual buttons to be pushed, ''Stander'' swerves in a more uncertain direction. The issue of apartheid recedes, and the film, which opens today in New York, becomes an unsettling character study camouflaged as a heist movie. The further the volatile title character evolves into a swaggering self-styled Robin Hood, the more his nobility begins to tarnish. By the end of the film, his demons have taken over, and he has become a compulsively self-destructive outlaw addicted to flouting authority."

Certainly the events the authors sought to describe were well known in their day. These were the repeated marches on Washington by aging World War I veterans who had been promised federal funds in recognition of their wartime sacrifice. These veterans came home as heroes only to discover, in the words of one historian, that ''the Keys to the City had turned out only to be a pass to the flophouse.'' In 1924, the returning soldiers had been promised government recompense for the time they had spent overseas. By the early 1930's, with the nation in the throes of the Great Depression, this issue took on added urgency. There were veterans who had given up their main sources of income in order to enlist. They came back jobless, unable to pay their taxes and in danger of losing their homes."

At the Independent Spirit Awards in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon, the big winner was ''Brokeback Mountain,'' which took best feature and best director (Ang Lee). ''Capote'' won best actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and best screenplay (Dan Futterman), and ''Transamerica'' won best actress (Felicity Huffman, right) and first screenplay (Duncan Tucker). The prizes are given by Film Independent, a nonprofit group that nurtures indie filmmakers. At the less reverent Razzies, the annual salute to the worst of Hollywood, Tom Cruise and his fiancée, Katie Holmes -- combined, they are the entity known in gossip columns simply as TomKat -- were named the ''most tiresome tabloid targets,'' a new prize meant to recognize the most overexposed celebrities. But the biggest winner at the awards, bestowed by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation, was ''Dirty Love,'' written by and starring the former Playboy Playmate Jenny McCarthy. It won four prizes, including worst picture, worst actress and screenplay (both for Ms. McCarthy), and worst director (John Mallory Asher). Grandma-in-Drag Tops Box Office In a slow weekend at the box office, Tyler Perry's comedy ''Madea's Family Reunion'' (Lions Gate) held off new films starring Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich to remain No. 1 for a second week. ''Madea,'' in which Mr. Perry, left, dresses up in dowdy drag as a Southern grandma working to organize a family gathering, took in an estimated $13 million. That was a drop of some 57 percent from its ticket sales last week, but still enough to top ''16 Blocks'' (Warner Brothers), a thriller starring Mr. Willis and Mos Def, which landed at No. 2 with $11.6 million. Two other new films had slow openings: ''Ultraviolet'' (Sony/Screen Gems), a sci-fi action picture starring Ms. Jovovich, took in $9 million, reaching No. 4, and ''Aquamarine'' (Fox), about a mermaid who appears at a seaside swimming pool, was No. 5 with $7.5 million. ''Eight Below'' (Buena Vista), about the survival of a pack of abandoned ice-sled dogs in the Antarctic, dropped one spot to No. 3 with $10.2 million in its third week of release, bring its total ticket sales to $58.7 million. Overall, the box office was down 16.5 percent from the weekend before, and 23.2 percent from the same weekend last year. Welcome Back, Edna Divine. Harvey Fierstein. Now John Travolta?

Doctorow's fictionalized tale of Sherman's march, an autobiography by Francine du Plessix Gray and a history of Chernobyl are among the winners of this year's National Book Critics Circle Awards.

Riot at Punk Concert Rioting broke out at a concert east of Los Angeles on Saturday night, injuring several people and destroying two police cars, The Associated Press reported. Two dozen mostly British punk bands, including GBH and the Adicts, were playing at ''British Invasion 2K6'' at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino. The rioting began when the police responded to a report of a stabbing. The crowd of 1,500 became agitated and several fights broke out, the police said. The officers extracted the stabbing victim and another person who had been beaten, but the violent crowd forced the police to withdraw. After calling for backup, officers lined up in phalanx formation to clear the area, firing pepper balls and tear gas to move the crowd. As the audience dispersed, rioters destroyed two police cars, set a trash bin on fire and smashed storefront windows, the police said.

American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. A1 The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.'' A6 Tsunami Project Stalled Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started. A8 Hints at Need for Iraq Change James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria. A1 American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months. A8 Japan and China Mend Fences China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors.

A9 NATIONAL A10-15 Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. A1 Virginia Republicans Resolute In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents. A1 For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year. A12 Races Hinge on Local Economy Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center has opted for a quieter remembrance of those tragic events with a three-week, three-part program dedicated to old, new and relatively unknown Hungarian cinema. The awkwardly titled RESISTANCE AND REBIRTH: HUNGARIAN CINEMA, 50 YEARS AFTER '56 actually encompasses separate but related points of interest: ''Remembering '56,'' which highlights work about the uprising and its aftermath, including Istvan Szabo's autobiographically informed 1966 film ''Father''; the self-explanatory ''Tribute to Miklos Jancso: The Currents of History''; and ''New Cinema From Hungary.'' In recent years, Hungary has pushed hard to become a European film hub, notably with financial incentives that have helped local and foreign production alike. The fruits of its newly revived cinema scene have been trickling into international film festivals and, on occasion, into American art houses. Lajos Koltai's extremely moving adaptation of the Nobel Prize-winner Imre Kertesz's personal novel about the Holocaust, ''Fateless,'' opened here in January to enthusiastic notices and scant public interest and is now, happily, available on DVD. Among the new works in the festival are the critical favorite ''Kontroll,'' which enjoyed a marginally better run last year, and the singularly enthralling opera ''Johanna,'' about an accident victim turned angel of mercy who prowls an atmospherically dilapidated hospital in which the sounds of music include the refrain ''Let's run to urology!''

He returns, to the Bill Hodges Gallery, with a blistering assembly of works in various mediums from the last couple of decades, among them a pair of closely observed black-and-white screen prints on canvas of the back of his shaved head, above. They resemble studies in phrenology, a pseudoscience sometimes used to justify racism. There is also a nice selection of black-and-white text paintings, including ''Untitled (Crowd/The Fire Next Time)'' (2000), a photographic image of an African-American crowd at a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in 1995 overlaid with a silkscreen in glistening coal dust of an excerpt from ''The Fire Next Time'' by James Baldwin. The text reads: ''Something in me wondered, 'What will happen to all the beauty?,' '' in this context suggesting a gentle satire of protest rallies and the civil rights cause. Mr. Ligon's appetite for traversing racial stereotypes finds vivid expression in his narratives, etchings on handmade paper purporting to be the title page of testimonials on his intrepid life and adventures among white people in the art world. They make you laugh, but like all good socially or politically engaged art, the pieces also have the underappreciated virtue of momentarily letting the viewer see the world through someone else's eyes.

No guards were hurt in the melee, which took place about 8 p.m. in a recreation yard, said Scott Bishop, a spokesman for the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, a union that represents prison guards. The brawl appeared to be part of a gang dispute and was similar to a fight on Sept. 3, he said."

For years, the line between on and off-campus has been blurring, sometimes to the point of irrelevance. For parents accompanying their children across this indistinct border today, I imagine that a dose of nostalgia must no doubt be mixed with a hefty helping of genuine shock. Where are the protesters? No hunger strikes or marches? No barricades or tear gas? On many campuses even the time-honored Frisbee toss is on the way out and the newer dormitories proudly bear the designation ""Riot Proof."" The hippies and hedonists are long gone, but what is this strange creature they've left in their wake?"

Slowly students begin to creep inside the building, down the hall, down the stairs, and out of the auditoriums. The time has come. There will be ten minutes between classes for me and my colleagues to go into the swarm of students and make as many people aware of our campaign and why it's important to ensure that University of Michigan apparel is not made in sweatshops. The results are minimal. A girl wearing Uggs enters the building, sees me with a flier and clipboard, and walks faster to avoid me. So does the young man wearing his fraternity letters, the punk rocker with his headphones, the stoner with dreadlocks and the hunched-over engineer. Those that I manage to talk to, nod their heads nonchalantly and look around to see if they see their friends, occasionally glancing at their wristwatch. Sometimes they skip all of that and ask just to sign the petition, without knowing what it concerns."

An Uncle Sam on stilts teetered above the crowd, another activist impersonated President Johnson and the San Francisco Mime Troupe appeared in whiteface as the Guerrilla Marching Band. Activists banged tambourines while students assembled to stage an obstructive sit-in at the building where recruiters from Dow Chemical Company, the military's supplier of napalm, were conducting placement interviews, as David Maraniss described the scene in They Marched Into Sunlight. The crowd of protestors had grown to well over a thousand by noon, and around 1:30 p.m., police forced their way in to clear the building. What happened next shocked the city and eventually the nation, as the churning mass of students inside the building fell like grain under the scything of police batons. Forty-seven students w ere treated at the university medical center that day, and many more left with eyes reddened by tear gas, released for the first time ever on the campus. Madison soon became known as one of the most anti-war campuses in America, considered by some to be the Berkeley of the Midwest. Madison saw protests again at the start of the build-up to the Iraq War, but nothing that could match the Vietnam protests for violence or cultural significance. In this, the campus serves as a microcosm for the nation's universities as a whole, a barometer of activism that has fallen over time. And as the status of the American campus has descended to a tepid lull, the attention of the American public has waned. There are no more headlines about student protests. The nation no longer knows or cares what happens on these serene islands of academia, even though someday these students will be solving the problems created by a leadership that came of age in Vietnam. Former Wisconsin administrator Paul Ginsberg, who watched both the Vietnam and Iraq antiwar movements unfold, found that the Iraq protests were marked by a certain placidness that barely disturbed the quiet serenity that reigned over campus. The result was classic pothole theory, a catchphrase harkening back to the Vietnam era: Nobody goes to harangue the city council until a pothole appears on their street. In short, nobody's paying attention to college students because they're not causing any fuss."

First, Mexican migrants in the United States have become an extension of Mexico's own politics, and ignored only at great peril. Second, American officials have little use for meetings with President Calderón during an election year in which the subject of immigration has ignited strong emotions on the campaign trail."

On Feb. 9 Henri Langlois, president of the National Cinémathèque Française in Paris and a shambling, revered godfather of the French New Wave, was removed from his post by André Malraux, the minister of culture in Charles de Gaulle's government. Young cinephiles reacted with outrage, and their angry protests flowed into a tide of political and social discontent that quickly reached the flood stage. Three months later the country was engulfed in riots, work stoppages and mass demonstrations. Some of France's most venerable traditions and institutions seemed to be under assault, and the Cannes Film Festival, the nation's glamorous and exalted cinematic rite of spring, was hardly immune. The festival came to a halt on May 19, after a group of filmmakers, including Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, professing solidarity with insurgent students and workers, rushed the stage at the Palais des Festivals and held down the curtain, preventing the scheduled screening from taking place."

A visceral fictionalized account of the 1999 demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade Organization, it repeatedly plunges you into the kicking and screaming melee of peaceful protest gone awry. Cries rend the air and bodies crumple as police batons are swung and tear-gas canisters explode. This is what happens, the movie warns, when the powers that be are unprepared for the magnitude of organized opposition and impulsively lash back. Resistance gives way to fury, and fury incites chaos. The filmmaking debut of Stuart Townsend, an Irish actor, ''Battle in Seattle'' makes no bones about where its sympathies lie. Except for the anarchistic fringe, it is wholeheartedly on the side of the demonstrators, a loose coalition of grass-roots activists from the environmental and labor movements joined by students and other groups who opposed globalization."

Near noon, I was sitting quietly in my hotel room in La Paz when the TV screen started streaming live footage of a riot. The spectacle of protest and provocation is so traditional here in Bolivia that it could be the national dance. But this riot looked different from those I'd seen before. For one thing, the rioters were awfully well dressed -- some were in spotless white government uniforms, and more than a few women hurled abuses while wearing high heels. Of more immediate concern, however, was the location, the Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz. My flight back to America was leaving in 30 hours, and now the tarmac appeared to be in a state of war: gray clouds of gas rolled one way, waves of protesters surged forward, throwing rocks, and lines of policemen fell back under assault. As usual in Bolivia, the riot had started as a labor dispute. The day before, the airport administrator had threatened to strike over the payment of landing fees, causing some international flights to be canceled. Then, at 3 a.m., a mysterious plane had touched down, disgorging elite Bolivian soldiers who occupied the control tower and restored the central government's authority."

Stepping off the plane in Paris in February 1969, Richard Nixon had a moment of sartorial panic, according to his biographer Richard Reeves: "" 'Here we go -- Vive la France!' Nixon said as he walked to the door to meet President de Gaulle at the bottom of the plane's steps. He saw that his host was wearing no coat in the bitter cold and stripped his own overcoat off before he stepped out the door."""

And Asif Ali Zardari, with the job of keeping his country from becoming the most dangerous failed state in the world.","TO ENTER the office where Asif Ali Zardari, the president of Pakistan, conducts his business, you head down a long corridor toward two wax statues of exceptionally tall soldiers, each in a long, white tunic with a glittering column of buttons. On closer inspection, these turn out to be actual humans who have been trained in the arts of immobility. The office they guard, though large, is not especially opulent or stupefying by the standards of such places. President Zardari met me just inside the doorway, then seated himself facing a widescreen TV displaying an image of fish swimming in a deep blue sea. His party spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, and his presidential spokesman, Farahnaz Ispahani, sat facing him, almost as rigid as the soldiers. Zardari is famous for straying off message and saying odd things or jumbling facts and figures. He is also famous for blaming his aides when things go wrong -- and things have been going wrong quite a lot lately. Zardari's aides didn't want him to talk to me. Now they were tensely waiting for a mishap. The president himself, natty in a navy suit, his black hair brilliantined to a sheen, was the very picture of ease. Zardari beamed when we talked about New York, where he often lived between 2004, when he was released from prison after eight years, and late 2007, when he returned to Pakistan not long after his wife, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated by terrorists. For all that painful recent history, Zardari is a suave and charming man with a sly grin, and he gives the impression of thoroughly enjoying what must be among the world's least desirable jobs. Zardari had just been through the most dangerous weeks of his six months in office. He dissolved the government in Punjab, Pakistan's dominant state, and called out the police to stop the country's lawyers and leading opposition party from holding a ''long march'' to demand the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been sacked, along with most of the high judiciary, by Zardari's predecessor, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Zardari defused the situation only by allowing Chaudhry's return to office and giving in to other demands that he had previously and repeatedly rejected."

SYRIA Protesters gathered on the streets of the southern city of Dara'a for a fourth consecutive day, witnesses said. The army entered the city for the first time to support the police, setting up checkpoints in the center of Dara'a and on the city's outskirts, according to a witness.

The revolution was almost three months old, and the hard work was just beginning, he told me. Mohyeldin had seen his life transformed during those amazing 18 days: battling police in clouds of tear gas, ferrying food to the protesters in Tahrir Square and cheering in awe as Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's modern-day pharaoh, was cast out in a youth-led revolt. Now he wanted to see what he could do to spread the revolution's high ideals in Egypt's agricultural heartland. And he was vaguely contemplating a political career, starting in the village of Kafr Shukr, where his grandfather, a former prime minister, was born. He parked his car outside his family's old house, now a weathered brick meeting hall along a dusty road lined with vegetable and fruit stalls. Donkey carts bumped along among the cars, and date palms sheltered the lush green fields beyond. Inside the hall, photographs of his grandfather and other relatives adorned the walls. A group of middle-aged local men in brown and gray galabias stood up and addressed him with the respect due to his family: ''Zakaria basha.''"

The Arab world's democratic uprising was five months old, and patience among the protesters in Taiz -- Yemen's second largest city -- was wearing thin. Maqtari had been one of the first and most fearless leaders of the movement. She is a remarkable figure: a 31-year-old university administrator and fiction writer, she is also a childless divorcee who refused, until recently, to wear the abaya, the all-covering gown that is practically mandatory for women in Yemen. Tiny and frail, she has a round, lovely face, with level brows and tranquil brown eyes. On that afternoon, Maqtari was standing in a crowd gathered around the city's General Security building -- an imposing six-story edifice flanked by guards -- when she heard cracking sounds. She looked up and saw that the officers on the building's roof were not just throwing rocks, as they had in the past. They were firing straight down into the crowd below. Within minutes, at least four people were dead and about 60 were wounded. Maqtari began running back toward ''Freedom Square,'' the intersection where thousands of protesters had been camped out for months demanding the resignation of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's strongman president. Then the real assault began. Armored vehicles, tanks and bulldozers began converging on the protesters' tent city from all sides. They fired tear gas and water cannons into the square and began shooting protesters at point-blank range. They doused the tents, which extended for hundreds of yards in every direction, with gasoline and lighted them on fire. None of the protesters had weapons. ''People were dying all around us, and there was nothing we could do,'' Maqtari told me. Some were burned alive. At around 11 p.m., Maqtari fled to her sister's house, about 200 yards uphill from the square. There, she and other protesters watched as flames engulfed the entire square, raging for several hours. Officers stormed through the local hospital and several field clinics where protesters were being treated, firing tear gas down the corridors, shooting up the ceilings and arresting doctors and nurses. Some thrust their gun butts into patients' wounds. Others were laughing hysterically, as if they were on drugs, Maqtari and others told me, and shouting into the darkness, ''Ali is your god!'' The next morning, amid the charred remains of the tents, someone had scrawled a sardonic reversal of the protesters' chants on a wall. ''The regime wants the fall of the people,'' it said."

The mukhabarat replied with tear gas, buckshot and bullets. ''Hot'' was how Abdullah described it as he typed. As safe houses go, the room he slept in was lavish. A wide-screen television shared space on the wall with framed Koranic verses, rendered in sloping gold script. The hot wind of the Syrian summer billowed the thick drapes like sails in a storm.

Nelson Rockefeller of New York employing his breathless signature adjective -- ''fabulous!'' He was speaking back then to President Richard Nixon and attributing ''a fabulous job'' to the state troopers hours after they took the prison in a barrage by rooftop riflemen who killed 10 hostages along with 29 inmates. The president is heard complimenting the governor for ''the courage you showed,'' their voices resounding from newly available White House tape recordings. A state investigation commission has long since quashed the celebration, establishing how reckless the governor was to allow troopers, some with shotguns, fire down through thick clouds of tear gas at the innocent and guilty alike massed in the prison yard.

The high turnout in a peaceful, orderly election contrasted sharply with the violence and chaos of the previous week, when hundreds of thousands returned to Tahrir Square after security forces killed at least 42 people and left 3,000 injured. But Washington should not be fooled by the peace that has returned to Egyptian streets. Even successful elections can not erase months of political mismanagement by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (S.C.A.F.) or the bloodshed committed under its auspices. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence in Tahrir, and has called on the S.C.A.F. to transfer power to civilians as soon as possible. That is a good start, but is not enough. Egypt's military rulers clearly believe that they have survived the political crisis, and have resisted calls for a more fundamental political change. The generals may prevail in the short term, as the numbers in Tahrir dwindle and Egyptians turn their attention back to the elections and political squabbles."

Election posters were plastered to every available surface, and a voice squawked loudly over a distant, tinny loudspeaker: ''God willing, we will all soon live in an era of social justice. The revolution taught us that we are all equal.'' As the sedan reached a crowded election rally outside a mosque, the back door opened and out stepped a striking man with deep-set eyes and a broad forehead. ''He is here!'' someone shouted. ''The hero of the revolution!'' Almost instantly, a murmur rippled through the crowd, and the man was surrounded by adoring fans. A pair of burly aides grabbed his arms and bustled him through. ''God is great!'' the crowd chanted as he smiled and waved, making his way toward a brightly lighted stage. ''Freedom and Justice! Tomorrow we will be strong!'' The man of the hour was Mohamed Beltagy, one of the central protagonists of the Egyptian Revolution and perhaps the country's most versatile and dynamic politician. He is a senior leader in the Muslim Brotherhood who, unlike his peers, is also beloved by many liberals for his fierce support of the protests in Tahrir Square. But in a country divided ever more sharply between Islamists and secularists, his ability to straddle both worlds has only grown more precarious. He has been attacked by hard-line protesters for his association with the Brotherhood and dressed down within the Brotherhood for his willingness to side so vocally with the revolutionaries. Even his appearance sets him apart: at 49, Beltagy looks sleek and youthful next to the Brotherhood's bearded, pot-bellied, somnolent top men. He wears dark suits and natty ties, like a flashy Cairene lawyer, but he also has a prominent zabiba, or prayer callous, in the middle of his forehead, the ritual badge of piety in Egypt."

If a sugar beet falls off a truck in a story by McGregor, it's safe to assume things won't go well for the car directly behind. In these 30 electric tales of menace, however, this wicked British writer is less interested in how things pan out than in capturing that awful moment when someone recognizes he is powerless to undo his fate. (For one luckless character, the real threat looms after she has survived a smashed windshield and been rescued by two seemingly model citizens.) This is a book of ominous preludes and chilling aftermaths: the incantatory account of a vacationer at a war-ravaged resort in the minutes before he drowns; the Pinteresque power play of a vicar's wife whose husband offers shelter to a gallingly manipulative stranger. McGregor stealthily commands our active engagement, scattering crumbs of data for us to pick through, gumshoe-style. The technique shrewdly exposes the disconnection of transgressive characters, like the miscreant father refused entry to his daughter's Nativity pageant, or the man who wreaks terrible vengeance on a noisy neighbor. The neighbor's punishment? McGregor puts faith in the cruelty of his readers' imaginations, leaving that to us."

They had crushed peaceful protesters last year, and their police had used tear gas against human rights activists. Like everybody else, including some of the Bahraini policemen I later spoke with, I was appalled at the violence and thought the monarchy had blood on its hands. But I felt that declining the offer was irresponsible. I wanted to know the monarchy's side of the story. So I accepted the invitation -- on the condition that I was free to meet Bahrain's opposition. Bahrain is a tiny island nation of 600,000 citizens, with a Parliament of only 40 members, and it cannot be understood if looked at in isolation. For one thing, it stands at the forefront of a regional cold war. Saudi Arabia lies to the west, connected by a 25-kilometer causeway built jointly by the Saudis and Bahrainis. To the east, across the waters of the Gulf, lies Iran. Both Tehran and Riyadh have major stakes in Bahrain."

A chronicle of protest and endurance, punctuated by violence and tiny glimmers of hope, this documentary is unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again. For anyone who retains an interest in the human contours of the situation, however, the movie is necessary, if difficult, viewing. For while it is hardly neutral -- presenting an extended, highly personal view of life in a West Bank village adjacent to Israel's controversial security fence -- ''5 Broken Cameras'' is much more than yet another polemical bulletin from an embattled region. It may seem perverse to praise an eyewitness account of political trauma for its formal accomplishments, but for a project like this to claim the attention of an audience it has to justify itself as cinema. There is no shortage of information and opinion about the Middle East, and this film, made collaboratively by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi, is partly a piece of advocacy journalism. But it is also a visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art."

The demonstrators tried to block people from entering the theater, throwing eggs, spitting on them, and shouting ''assassins'' and ''fascists.''"

Universal is where, having made movies in Weimar Berlin and pre-World War II Paris, Siodmak reinvented himself in the 1940s as an American director, and the retrospective includes films like ''The Killers,''''Cobra Woman'' and ''Phantom Lady.''"

Do not put it in your cellphones, because if you get arrested, the cops will take those away. Write it on your bodies. In indelible ink. There are Sharpies on the table.''

Instead, thousands of Occupy protesters met at various ''strike stations'' and fanned out into the streets with shields and gas masks (or the homemade alternative: bandannas soaked in vinegar), transforming downtown Oakland into a roving carnival of keyed-up militants of every shape and size: graduate students, tenured professors, professional revolutionaries, members of the Black Bloc, dressed like ninjas, their faces obscured."

At least 45 people were injured when the security forces broke up three separate protests across Bahrain on Thursday, they said. Bahrain crushed an uprising led by majority Shiite Muslims last year, but protest marches and rallies continue. Shiites say they have long been marginalized in political and economic life, an accusation the government denies. Bahrain's Sunni rulers have rejected the main opposition demand: an elected parliament with full powers to pass laws and form governments. The head of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, Mohammed al-Maskati, said Zainab al-Khawaja was arrested Friday when she tried to hold a solitary sit-in near the capital, Manama. She is the daughter of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a leading Shiite figure in the uprising who ended a long hunger strike in May after drawing attention to the issue of imprisoned activists."

There was free coffee, oatmeal, doughnuts, fliers with the day's agenda and plenty of pot. A ''street medic'' -- ''I just finished a wilderness first-aid course,'' he told me when I asked about his training -- tended to his first case of the day, a man in his 20s whose leg had been beaten to a purple hue with a metal rod in an overnight fight in the park. Nearby, an organizer reminded protesters to take down the toll-free number for the National Lawyers Guild: ''This is important. Do not put it in your cellphones, because if you get arrested, the cops will take those away. Write it on your bodies. In indelible ink. There are Sharpies on the table.''No central action was planned. A coalition of labor unions had asked Occupy Oakland, with its proven ability to turn out large numbers of militant activists, to blockade the Golden Gate Bridge, but then withdrew the request at the last minute. Instead, thousands of Occupy protesters met at various ''strike stations'' and fanned out into the streets with shields and gas masks (or the homemade alternative: bandannas soaked in vinegar), transforming downtown Oakland into a roving carnival of keyed-up militants of every shape and size: graduate students, tenured professors, professional revolutionaries, members of the Black Bloc, dressed like ninjas, their faces obscured."
